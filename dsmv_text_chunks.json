["Disorder: Delusional Disorder\nICD-9: 297. 1, ICD-10: F22\nNotes: \nDiagnostic Criteria:\n  A: The presence of one (or more) delusions with a duration of 1 month or longer. B: Criterion A for schizophrenia has never been met. Note: Hallucinations, if present, are not prominent and are related to the delusional theme (e. g. , the sensation of being infested with insects associated with delusions of infestation). C: Apart from the impact of the delusion(s) or its ramifications, functioning is not markedly impaired, and behavior is not obviously bizarre or odd. D: If manic or major depressive episodes have occurred, these have been brief relative to the duration of the delusional periods\n  E: The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or another medical condition and is not better explained by another mental disorder, such as body dysmorphic disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder. Disorder Id: 23\nDiagnostic Features: The essential feature of delusional disorder is the presence of one or more delusions that persist for at least 1 month (Criterion A). A diagnosis of delusional disorder is not given if the individual has ever had a symptom presentation that met Criterion A for schizophrenia (Criterion B). Apart from the direct impact of the delusions, impairments in psychosocial functioning may be more circumscribed than those seen in other psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia, and behavior is not obviously bizarre or odd (Criterion C). If mood episodes occur concurrently with the delusions, the total duration of these mood episodes is brief relative to the total duration of the delusional periods (Criterion D). The delusions are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e. g. , cocaine) or another medical condition (e. g. , Alzheimer's disease) and are not better explained by another mental disorder, such as body dysmorphic disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder (Criterion E). In addition to the five symptom domain areas identified in the diagnostic criteria, the assessment of cognition, depression, and mania symptom domains is vital for making critically important distinctions between the various schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders. Recording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis: Social, marital, or work problems can result from the delusional beliefs of delusional disorder. Individuals with delusional disorder may be able to factually describe that others view their beliefs as irrational but are unable to accept this themselves (i. e. , there may be \"factual insight\" but no true insight). Many individuals develop irritable or dysphoric mood, which can usually be understood as a reaction to their delusional beliefs. Anger and violent behavior can occur with persecutory, jealous, and \u00e9rotomanie types. The individual may engage in htigious or antagonistic behavior (e. g. , sending hundreds of letters of protest to the government). Legal difficulties can occur, particularly in jealous and \u00e9rotomanie types. Prevalence: The lifetime prevalence of delusional disorder has been estimated at around 0. 2%, and the most frequent subtype is persecutory. Delusional disorder, jealous type, is probably more common in males than in females, but there are no major gender differences in the overall frequency of delusional disorder\nDevelopment And Course: On average, global function is generally better than that observed in schizophrenia. Although the diagnosis is generally stable, a proportion of individuals go on to develop schizophrenia. Delusional disorder has a significant familial relationship with both schizophrenia and schizotypal personality disorder. Although it can occur in younger age groups, the condition may be more prevalent in older individuals. Risk And Prognostic Factors:  \nCulture Related Diagnostic Issues: An individual's cultural and religious background must be taken into account in evaluating the possible presence of delusional disorder. The content of delusions also varies across cultural contexts\nGender Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nSuicide Risk:  \nFunctional Consequences: The functional impairment is usually more circumscribed than that seen with other psychotic disorders, although in some cases, the impairment may be substantial and include poor occupational functioning and social isolation. When poor psychosocial functioning is present, delusional beliefs themselves often play a significant role. A common characteristic of individuals with delusional disorder is the apparent normality of their behavior and appearance when their delusional ideas are not being discussed or acted on\nDiagnostic Markers:  \nDifferential Diagnosis: Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders. If an individual with obsessive-compulsive disorder is completely convinced that his or her obsessive-compulsive disorder beliefs are true, then the diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder, with absent insight/delusional beliefs specifier, should be given rather than a diagnosis of delusional disorder. Similarly, if an individual with body dysmorphic disorder is completely convinced that his or her body dysmorphic disorder beliefs are true, then the diagnosis of body dysmorphic disorder, with absent insight/delusional beliefs specifier, should be given rather than a diagnosis of delusional disorder. Delirium, major neurocognitive disorder, psychotic disorder due to another medical condition, and substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder. Individuals with these disorders may present with symptoms that suggest delusional disorder. For example, simple persecutory delusions in the context of major neurocognitive disorder would be diagnosed as major neurocognitive disorder, with behavioral disturbance. A substance/ medication-induced psychotic disorder cross-sectionally may be identical in symptomatology to delusional disorder but can be distinguished by the chronological relationship of substance use to the onset and remission of the delusional beliefs. Schizophrenia and schizophreniform disorder. Delusional disorder can be distinguished from schizophrenia and schizophreniform disorder by the absence of the other characteristic symptoms of the active phase of schizophrenia. Depressive and bipolar disorders and schizoaffective disorder. These disorders may be distinguished from delusional disorder by the temporal relationship between the mood disturbance and the delusions and by the severity of the mood symptoms. If delusions occur exclusively during mood episodes, the diagnosis is depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features. Mood symptoms that meet full criteria for a mood episode can be superimposed on delusional disorder. Delusional disorder can be diagnosed only if the total duration of all mood episodes remains brief relative to the total duration of the delusional disturbance. If not, then a diagnosis of other specified or unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder accompanied by other specified depressive disorder, unspecified depressive disorder, other specified bipolar and related disorder, or unspecified bipolar and related disorder is appropriate. Comorbidity:  \nRelationship To Other Classifications:.", "Disorder: Brief Psychotic Disorder\nICD-9: 298. 8, ICD-10: F23\nNotes: \nDiagnostic Criteria:\n  A: Presence of one (or more) of the following symptoms. At least one of these must be (1), (2), or (3):\n    - {'dccd_id': '44', 'dcc_id': '61', 'parent_dccd_id': '0', 'dccd_key': '1', 'dccd_value': 'Delusions'}\n    - {'dccd_id': '45', 'dcc_id': '61', 'parent_dccd_id': '0', 'dccd_key': '2', 'dccd_value': 'Hallucinations'}\n    - {'dccd_id': '46', 'dcc_id': '61', 'parent_dccd_id': '0', 'dccd_key': '3', 'dccd_value': 'Disorganized speech (e. g. , frequent derailment or incoherance)'}\n    - {'dccd_id': '47', 'dcc_id': '61', 'parent_dccd_id': '0', 'dccd_key': '4', 'dccd_value': 'Grossly disorganized or cataonic behavior'}\n  B: Duration of an episode of the disturbance is at least 1 day but less than 1 month, with eventual full return to premorbid level of functioning. C: The disturbance is not better explained by major depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features or another psychotic disorder such as schizophrenia or catatonia, and is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e. g. , a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition\nDisorder Id: 24\nDiagnostic Features: The essential feature of brief psychotic disorder is a disturbance that involves the sudden onset of at least one of the following positive psychotic symptoms: delusions, hallucinations, disorganized speech (e. g. , frequent derailment or incoherence), or grossly abnormal psychomotor behavior, including catatonia (Criterion A). Sudden onset is defined as change from a nonpsychotic state to a clearly psychotic state within 2 weeks, usually without a prodrome. An episode of the disturbance lasts at least 1 day but less than 1 month, and the individual eventually has a full return to the premorbid level of functioning (Cri\u00ad terion B). The disturbance is not better explained by a depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features, by schizoaffective disorder, or by schizophrenia and is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e. g. , a hallucinogen) or another medical condition (e. g. , subdural hematoma) (Criterion C). In addition to the five symptom domain areas identified in the diagnostic criteria, the assessment of cognition, depression, and mania symptom domains is vital for making critically important distinctions between the various schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders. Recording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis: Individuals with brief psychotic disorder typically experience emotional turmoil or overwhelming confusion. They may have rapid shifts from one intense affect to another. Although the disturbance is brief, the level of impairment may be severe, and supervision may be required to ensure that nutritional and hygienic needs are met and that the individual is protected from the consequences of poor judgment, cognitive impairment, or acting on the basis of delusions. There appears to be an increased risk of suicidal behavior, particularly during the acute episode\nPrevalence: In the United States, brief psychotic disorder may account for 9% of cases of first-onset psychosis. Psychotic disturbances that meet Criteria A and C, but not Criterion B, for brief psychotic disorder (i. e. , duration of active symptoms is 1-6 months as opposed to remission within 1 month) are more common in developing countries than in developed countries. Brief psychotic disorder is twofold more common in females than in males\nDevelopment And Course: Brief psychotic disorder may appear in adolescence or early adulthood, and onset can occur across the lifespan, with the average age at onset being the mid 30s. By definition, a diagnosis of brief psychotic disorder requires a full remission of all symptoms and an eventual full return to the premorbid level of functioning within 1 month of the onset of the disturbance. In some individuals, the duration of psychotic symptoms may be quite brief (e. g. , a few days)\nRisk And Prognostic Factors: Temperamental. Preexisting personality disorders and traits (e. g. , schizotypal personality disorder; borderline personality disorder; or traits in the psychoticism domain, such as perceptual dysregulation, and the negative affectivity domain, such as suspiciousness) may predispose the individual to the development of the disorder. Culture Related Diagnostic Issues: It is important to distinguish symptoms of brief psychotic disorder from culturally sanctioned response patterns. For example, in some religious ceremonies, an individual may report hearing voices, but these do not generally persist and are not perceived as abnormal by most members of the individual's community. In addition, cultural and religious background must be taken into account when considering whether beliefs are delusional\nGender Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nSuicide Risk:  \nFunctional Consequences: Despite high rates of relapse, for most individuals, outcome is excellent in terms of social functioning and symptomatology\nDiagnostic Markers:  \nDifferential Diagnosis: Other medical conditions. A variety of medical disorders can manifest with psychotic symptoms of short duration. Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition or a delirium is diagnosed when there is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory tests that the delusions or hallucinations are the direct physiological consequence of a specific medical condition (e. g. , Cushing's syndrome, brain tumor) (see 'Tsychotic Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition\" later in this chapter). Substance-related disorders. Substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder, substance-induced delirium, and substance intoxication are distinguished from brief psychotic disorder by the fact that a substance (e. g. , a drug of abuse, a medication, exposure to a toxin) is judged to be etiologically related to the psychotic symptoms (see ''Substance/MedicationInduced Psychotic Disorder\" later in this chapter). Laboratory tests, such as a urine drug screen or a blood alcohol level, may be helpful in making this determination, as may a careful history of substance use with attention to temporal relationships between substance intake and onset of the symptoms and to the nature of the substance being used. Depressive and bipolar disorders. The diagnosis of brief psychotic disorder cannot be made if the psychotic symptoms are better explained by a mood episode (i. e. , the psychotic symptoms occur exclusively during a full major depressive, manic, or mixed episode). Other psychotic disorders. If the psychotic symptoms persist for 1 month or longer, the diagnosis is either schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, depressive disorder with psychotic features, bipolar disorder with psychotic features, or other specified or unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder, depending on the other symptoms in the presentation. The differential diagnosis between brief psychotic disorder and schizophreniform disorder is difficult when the psychotic symptoms have remitted before 1 month in response to successful treatment with medication. Careful attention should be given to the possibility that a recurrent disorder (e. g. , bipolar disorder, recurrent acute exacerbations of schizophrenia) may be responsible for any recurring psychotic episodes. Malingering and factitious disorders. An episode of factitious disorder, with predominantly psychological signs and symptoms, may have the appearance of brief psychotic disorder, but in such cases there is evidence that the symptoms are intentionally produced. When malingering involves apparently psychotic symptoms, there is usually evidence that the illness is being feigned for an understandable goal. Personality disorders. In certain individuals with personality disorders, psychosocial stressors may precipitate brief periods of psychotic symptoms. These symptoms are usually transient and do not warrant a separate diagnosis. If psychotic symptoms persist for at least 1 day, an additional diagnosis of brief psychotic disorder may be appropriate\nComorbidity:  \nRelationship To Other Classifications:.", "Disorder: Schizophreniform Disorder\nICD-9: 295. 40, ICD-10: F20. 81\nNotes: \nDiagnostic Criteria:\n  A: Two (or more) of the following, each present for a significant portion of time during a 1-month period (or less if successfully treated). At least one of these must be (1), (2), or (3):\n    - {'dccd_id': '48', 'dcc_id': '64', 'parent_dccd_id': '0', 'dccd_key': '1', 'dccd_value': 'Delusions'}\n    - {'dccd_id': '49', 'dcc_id': '64', 'parent_dccd_id': '0', 'dccd_key': '2', 'dccd_value': 'Hallucinations'}\n    - {'dccd_id': '50', 'dcc_id': '64', 'parent_dccd_id': '0', 'dccd_key': '3', 'dccd_value': 'Disorganized speech (e. g. , frequent derailment or incoherance)'}\n    - {'dccd_id': '51', 'dcc_id': '64', 'parent_dccd_id': '0', 'dccd_key': '4', 'dccd_value': 'Grossly disorganized or cataonic behavior'}\n    - {'dccd_id': '52', 'dcc_id': '64', 'parent_dccd_id': '0', 'dccd_key': '5', 'dccd_value': 'Negative symptoms (i. e. , diminished emotional expression or avolition)'}\n  B: An episode of the disorder lasts at least 1 month but less than 6 months. When the diagnosis must be made without waiting for recovery, it should be qualified as \u201cprovisional. \u201d\n  C: Schizoaffective disorder and depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features have been ruled out because either 1 ) no major depressive or manic episodes have occurred concurrently with the active-phase symptoms, or 2) if mood episodes have occurred during active-phase symptoms, they have been present for a minority of the total duration of the active and residual periods of the illness\n  D: The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e. g. , a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition\nDisorder Id: 25\nDiagnostic Features: The characteristic symptoms of schizophreniform disorder are identical to those of schizophrenia (Criterion A). Schizophreniform disorder is distinguished by its difference in duration: the total duration of the illness, including prodromal, active, and residual phases, is at least 1 month but less than 6 months (Criterion B). The duration requirement for schizophreniform disorder is intermediate between that for brief psychotic disorder, which lasts more than 1 day and remits by 1 month, and schizophrenia, which lasts for at least 6 months. The diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder is made under two conditions. 1) when an episode of illness lasts between 1 and 6 months and the individual has already recovered, and 2) when an individual is symptomatic for less than the 6 months' duration required for the diagnosis of schizophrenia but has not yet recovered. In this case, the diagnosis should be noted as \"schizophreniform disorder (provisional)\" because it is uncertain if the individual will recover from the disturbance within the 6-month period. If the disturbance persists beyond 6 months, the diagnosis should be changed to schizophrenia. Another distinguishing feature of schizophreniform disorder is the lack of a criterion requiring impaired social and occupational functioning. While such impairments may potentially be present, they are not necessary for a diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder. In addition to the five symptom domain areas identified in the diagnostic criteria, the assessment of cognition, depression, and mania symptom domains is vital for making critically important distinctions between the various schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders\nRecording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis: As with schizophrenia, currently there are no laboratory or psychometric tests for schizophreniform disorder. There are multiple brain regions where neuroimaging, neuropathological, and neurophysiological research has indicated abnormalities, but none are diagnostic. Prevalence: Incidence of schizophreniform disorder across sociocultural settings is likely similar to that observed in schizophrenia. In the United States and other developed countries, the incidence is low, possibly fivefold less than that of schizophrenia. In developing countries, the incidence may be higher, especially for the specifier ''with good prognostic features\"; in some of these settings schizophreniform disorder may be as common as schizophrenia\nDevelopment And Course: The development of schizophreniform disorder is similar to that of schizophrenia. About one-third of individuals with an initial diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder (provisional) recover within the 6-month period and schizophreniform disorder is their final diagnosis. The majority of the remaining two-thirds of individuals will eventually receive a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder\nRisk And Prognostic Factors: Genetic and physiological. Relatives of individuals with schizophreniform disorder have an increased risk for schizophrenia\nCulture Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nGender Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nSuicide Risk:  \nFunctional Consequences: For the majority of individuals with schizophreniform disorder who eventually receive a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, the functional consequences are similar to the consequences of those disorders. Most individuals experience dysfunction in several areas of daily functioning, such as school or work, interpersonal relationships, and self-care. Individuals who recover from schizophreniform disorder have better functional outcomes. Diagnostic Markers:  \nDifferential Diagnosis: Other mental disorders and medical conditions. A wide variety of mental and medical conditions can manifest with psychotic symptoms that must be considered in the differential diagnosis of schizophreniform disorder. These include psychotic disorder due to another medical condition or its treatment; delirium or major neurocognitive disorder; substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder or delirium; depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features; schizoaffective disorder; other specified or unspecified bipolar and related disorder; depressive or bipolar disorder with catatonic features; schizophre- nia; brief psychotic disorder; delusional disorder; other specified or unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder; schizotypal, schizoid, or paranoid personality disorders; autism spectrum disorder; disorders presenting in childhood with disorganized speech; attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; obsessive-compulsive disorder; posttraumatic stress disorder; and traumatic brain injury. Since the diagnostic criteria for schizophreniform disorder and schizophrenia differ primarily in duration of illness, the discussion of the differential diagnosis of schizophrenia also applies to schizophreniform disorder. Brief psychotic disorder. Schizophreniform disorder differs in duration from brief psychotic disorder, which has a duration of less than 1 month. Comorbidity:  \nRelationship To Other Classifications:.", "Disorder: Schizophrenia\nICD-9: 295. 90, ICD-10: F20. 9\nNotes: \nDiagnostic Criteria:\n  A: Two (or more) of the following, each present for a significant portion of time during a 1 -month period (or less if successfully treated). At least one of these must be (1 ), (2), or (3):\n    - {'dccd_id': '53', 'dcc_id': '68', 'parent_dccd_id': '0', 'dccd_key': '1', 'dccd_value': 'Delusions'}\n    - {'dccd_id': '54', 'dcc_id': '68', 'parent_dccd_id': '0', 'dccd_key': '2', 'dccd_value': 'Hallucinations'}\n    - {'dccd_id': '55', 'dcc_id': '68', 'parent_dccd_id': '0', 'dccd_key': '3', 'dccd_value': 'Disorganized speech (e. g. , frequent derailment or incoherance)'}\n    - {'dccd_id': '56', 'dcc_id': '68', 'parent_dccd_id': '0', 'dccd_key': '4', 'dccd_value': 'Grossly disorganized or cataonic behavior'}\n    - {'dccd_id': '57', 'dcc_id': '68', 'parent_dccd_id': '0', 'dccd_key': '5', 'dccd_value': 'Negative symptoms (i. e. , diminished emotional expression or avolition)'}\n  B: For a significant portion of the time since the onset of the disturbance, level of functioning in one or more major areas, such as work, interpersonal relations, or self-care, is markedly below the level achieved prior to the onset (or when the onset is in childhood or adolescence, there is failure to achieve expected level of interpersonal, academic, or occupational functioning)\n  C: Continuous signs of the disturbance persist for at least 6 months. This 6-month period must include at least 1 month of symptoms (or less if successfully treated) that meet Criterion A (i. e. , active-phase symptoms) and may include periods of prodromal or residual symptoms. During these prodromal or residual periods, the signs of the disturbance may be manifested by only negative symptoms or by two or more symptoms listed in Criterion A present in an attenuated form (e. g. , odd beliefs, unusual perceptual experiences)\n  D: Schizoaffective disorder and depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features have been ruled out because either 1 ) no major depressive or manic episodes have occurred concurrently with the active-phase symptoms, or 2) if mood episodes have occurred during active-phase symptoms, they have been present for a minority of the total duration of the active and residual periods of the illness\n  E: The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e. g. , a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition\n  F: If there is a history of autism spectrum disorder or a communication disorder of childhood onset, the additional diagnosis of schizophrenia is made only if prominent delusions or hallucinations, in addition to the other required symptoms of schizophrenia, are also present for at least 1 month (or less if successfully treated). Disorder Id: 26\nDiagnostic Features: The characteristic symptoms of schizophrenia involve a range of cognitive, behavioral, and emotional dysfunctions, but no single symptom is pathognomonic of the disorder. The diagnosis involves the recognition of a constellation of signs and symptoms associated with impaired occupational or social functioning. Individuals with the disorder will vary substantially on most features, as schizophrenia is a heterogeneous clinical syndrome. At least two Criterion A symptoms must be present for a significant portion of time during a 1-month period or longer. At least one of these symptoms must be the clear presence of delusions (Criterion Al), hallucinations (Criterion A2), or disorganized speech (Criterion A3). Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior (Criterion A4) and negative symptoms (Criterion A5) may also be present. In those situations in which the activephase symptoms remit within a month in response to treatment. Criterion A is still met if the clinician estimates that they would have persisted in the absence of treatment. Schizophrenia involves impairment in one or more major areas of functioning (Criterion B). If the disturbance begins in childhood or adolescence, the expected level of function is not attained. Comparing the individual with unaffected siblings may be helpful. The dysfunction persists for a substantial period during the course of the disorder and does not appear to be a direct result of any single feature. Avolition (i. e. , reduced drive to pursue goal-directed behavior; Criterion A5) is linked to the social dysfunction described under Criterion B. There is also strong evidence for a relationship between cognitive impairment (see the section \"Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis\" for this disorder) and functional impairment in individuals with schizophrenia. Some signs of the disturbance must persist for a continuous period of at least 6 months (Criterion C). Pi;odromal symptoms often precede the active phase, and residual symptoms may follow it, characterized by mild or subthreshold forms of hallucinations or delusions. Individuals may express a variety of unusual or odd beliefs that are not of delusional proportions (e. g. , ideas of reference or magical thinking); they may have unusual perceptual experiences (e. g. , sensing the presence of an unseen person); their speech may be generally understandable but vague; and their behavior may be unusual but not grossly disorganized (e. g. , mumbling in public). Negative symptoms are common in the prodromal and residual phases and can be severe. Individuals who had been socially active may become withdrawn from previous routines. Such behaviors are often the first sign of a disorder. Mood symptoms and full mood episodes are common in schizophrenia and may be concurrent with active-phase symptomatology. However, as distinct from a psychotic mood disorder, a schizophrenia diagnosis requires the presence of delusions or hallucinations in the absence of mood episodes. In addition, mood episodes, taken in total, should be present for only a minority of the total duration of the active and residual periods of the illness. In addition to the five symptom domain areas identified in the diagnostic criteria, the assessment of cognition, depression, and mania symptom domains is vital for making critically important distinctions between the various schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders. Recording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis: Individuals with schizophrenia may display inappropriate affect (e. g. , laughing in the absence of an appropriate stimulus); a dysphoric mood that can take the form of depression, anxiety, or anger; a disturbed sleep pattern (e. g. , daytime sleeping and nighttime activity); and a lack of interest in eating or food refusal. Depersonalization, derealization, and somatic concerns may occur and sometimes reach delusional proportions. Anxiety and phobias are common. Cognitive deficits in schizophrenia are conrmion and are strongly linked to vocational and functional impairments. These deficits can include decrements in declarative memory, working memory, language function, and other executive functions, as well as slower processing speed. Abnormalities in sensory processing and inhibitory capacity, as well as reductions in attention, are also found. Some individuals with schizophrenia show social cognition deficits, including deficits in the ability to infer the intentions of other people (theory of mind), and may attend to and then inte\u03c6ret irrelevant events or stimuli as meaningful, perhaps leading to the generation of explanatory delusions. These impairments frequently persist during symptomatic remission. Some individuals with psychosis may lack insight or awareness of their disorder (i. e. , anosognosia). This lack of \"'insight\" includes unawareness of symptoms of schizophrenia and may be present throughout the entire course of the illness. Unawareness of illness is typically a symptom of schizophrenia itself rather than a coping strategy. It is comparable to the lack of awareness of neurological deficits following brain damage, termed anosognosia. This symptom is the most common predictor of non-adherence to treatment, and it predicts higher relapse rates, increased number of involuntary treatments, poorer psychosocial functioning, aggression, and a poorer course of illness. Hostility and aggression can be associated with schizophrenia, although spontaneous or random assault is uncommon. Aggression is more frequent for younger males and for individuals with a past history of violence, non-adherence with treatment, substance abuse, and impulsivity. It should be noted that the vast majority of persons with schizophrenia are not aggressive and are more frequently victimized than are individuals in the general population. Currently, there are no radiological, laboratory, or psychometric tests for the disorder. Differences are evident in multiple brain regions between groups of healthy individuals and persons with schizophrenia, including evidence from neuroimaging, neuropathological, and neurophysiological studies. Differences are also evident in cellular architecture, white matter connectivity, and gray matter volume in a variety of regions such as the prefrontal and temporal cortices. Reduced overall brain volume has been observed, as well as increased brain volume reduction with age. Brain volume reductions with age are more pronounced in individuals with schizophrenia than in healthy individuals. Finally, individuals with schizophrenia appear to differ from individuals without the disorder in eyetracking and electrophysiological indices. Neurological soft signs common in individuals with schizophrenia include impairments in motor coordination, sensory integration, and motor sequencing of complex movements; left-right confusion; and disinhibition of associated movements. In addition, minor physical anomalies of the face and limbs may occur. Prevalence: The lifetime prevalence of schizophrenia appears to be approximately 0. 3%-0. 7%, although there is reported variation by race/ethnicity, across countries, and by geographic origin for immigrants and children of immigrants. The sex ratio differs across samples and populations: for example, an emphasis on negative symptoms and longer duration of disorder (associated with poorer outcome) shows higher incidence rates for males, whereas definitions allowing for the inclusion of more mood symptoms and brief presentations (associated with better outcome) show equivalent risks for both sexes\nDevelopment And Course: The psychotic features of schizophrenia typically emerge between the late teens and the mid-30s; onset prior to adolescence is rare. The peak age at onset for the first psychotic episode is in the early- to mid-20s for males and in the late-20s for females. The onset may be abrupt or insidious, but the majority of individuals manifest a slow and gradual development of a variety of clinically significant signs and symptoms. Half of these individuals complain of depressive symptoms. Earlier age at onset has traditionally been seen as a predictor of worse prognosis. However, the effect of age at onset is likely related to gender, with males having worse premorbid adjustment, lower educational achievement, more prominent negative symptoms and cognitive impairment, and in general a worse outcome. Impaired cognition is common, and alterations in cognition are present during development and precede the emergence of psychosis, taking the form of stable cognitive impairments during adulthood. Cognitive impairments may persist when other symptoms are in remission and contribute to the disability of the disease. The predictors of course and outcome are largely unexplained, and course and outcome may not be reliably predicted. The course appears to be favorable in about 20% of those with schizophrenia, and a small number of individuals are reported to recover completely. However, most individuals with schizophrenia still require formal or informal daily living supports, and many remain chronically ill, with exacerbations and remissions of active symptoms, while others have a course of progressive deterioration. Psychotic symptoms tend to diminish over the life course, perhaps in association with normal age-related declines in dopamine activity. Negative symptoms are more closely related to prognosis than are positive symptoms and tend to be the most persistent. Furthermore, cognitive deficits associated with the illness may not improve over the course of the illness. The essential features of schizophrenia are the same in childhood, but it is more difficult to make the diagnosis. In children, delusions and hallucinations may be less elaborate than in adults, and visual hallucinations are more common and should be distinguished from normal fantasy play. Disorganized speech occurs in many disorders with childhood onset (e. g. , autism spectrum disorder), as does disorganized behavior (e. g. , attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder). These symptoms should not be attributed to schizophrenia without due consideration of the more common disorders of childhood. Childhood-onset cases tend to resemble poor-outcome adult cases, with gradual onset and prominent negative symptoms. Children who later receive the diagnosis of schizophrenia are more likely to have experienced nonspecific emotional-behavioral disturbances and psychopathology, intellectual and language alterations, and subtle motor delays. Late-onset cases (i. e. , onset after age 40 years) are overrepresented by females, who may have married. Often, the course is characterized by a predominance of psychotic symptoms with preservation of affect and social functioning. Such late-onset cases can still meet the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia, but it is not yet clear whether this is the same condition as schizophrenia diagnosed prior to mid-life (e. g. , prior to age 55 years). Risk And Prognostic Factors: Environmental. Season of birth has been linked to the incidence of schizophrenia, including late winter/early spring in some locations and summer for the deficit form of the disease. The incidence of schizophrenia and related disorders is higher for children growing up in an urban environment and for some minority ethnic groups. Genetic and physiological. There is a strong contribution for genetic factors in determining risk for schizophrenia, although most individuals who have been diagnosed with schizophrenia have no family history of psychosis. Liability is conferred by a spectrum of risk alleles, common and rare, with each allele contributing only a small fraction to the total population variance. The risk alleles identified to date are also associated with other mental disorders, including bipolar disorder, depression, and autism spectrum disorder. Pregnancy and birth complications with hypoxia and greater paternal age are associated with a higher risk of schizophrenia for the developing fetus. In addition, other prenatal and perinatal adversities, including stress, infection, malnutrition, maternal diabetes, and other medical conditions, have been linked with schizophrenia. However, the vast majority of offspring with these risk factors do not develop schizophrenia. Culture Related Diagnostic Issues: Cultural and socioeconomic factors must be considered, particularly when the individual and the clinician do not share the same cultural and socioeconomic background. Ideas that appear to be delusional in one culture (e. g. , witchcraft) may be commonly held in another. In some cultures, visual or auditory hallucinations with a religious content (e. g. , hearing God's voice) are a normal part of religious experience. In addition, the assessment of disorganized speech may be made difficult by linguistic variation in narrative styles across cultures. The assessment of affect requires sensitivity to differences in styles of emotional expression, eye contact, and body language, which vary across cultures. If the assessment is conducted in a language that is different from the individual's primary language, care must be taken to ensure that alogia is not related to linguistic barriers. In certain cultures, distress may take the form of hallucinations or pseudo-hallucinations and overvalued ideas that may present clinically similar to true psychosis but are normative to the patient's subgroup\nGender Related Diagnostic Issues: A number of features distinguish the clinical expression of schizophrenia in females and males. The general incidence of schizophrenia tends to be slightly lower in females, particularly among treated cases. The age at onset is later in females, with a second mid-life peak as described earlier (see the section \"Development and Course\" for this disorder). Symptoms tend to be more affect-laden among females, and there are more psychotic symptoms, as well as a greater propensity for psychotic symptoms to worsen in later life. Other symptom differences include less frequent negative symptoms and disorganization. Finally, social functioning tends to remain better preserved in females. There are, however, frequent exceptions to these general caveats. Suicide Risk: Approximately 5%-6% of individuals with schizophrenia die by suicide, about 20% attempt suicide on one or more occasions, and many more have significant suicidal ideation. Suicidal behavior is sometimes in response to command hallucinations to harm oneself or others. Suicide risk remains high over the whole lifespan for males and females, although it may be especially high for younger males with comorbid substance use. Other risk factors include having depressive symptoms or feelings of hopelessness and being unemployed, and the risk is higher, also, in the period after a psychotic episode or hospital discharge\nFunctional Consequences: Schizophrenia is associated with significant social and occupational dysfunction. Making educational progress and maintaining employment are frequently impaired by avolition or other disorder manifestations, even when the cognitive skills are sufficient for the tasks at hand. Most individuals are employed at a lower level than their parents, and most, particularly men, do not marry or have limited social contacts outside of their family\nDiagnostic Markers:  \nDifferential Diagnosis: Major depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic or catatonic features. The distinction between schizophrenia and major depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features or with catatonia depends on the temporal relationship between the mood disturbance and the psychosis, and on the severity of the depressive or manic symptoms. If delusions or hallucinations occur exclusively during a major depressive or manic episode, the diagnosis is depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features. Schizoaffective disorder. A diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder requires that a major depressive or manic episode occur concurrently with the active-phase symptoms and that the mood symptoms be present for a majority of the total duration of the active periods. Schizophreniform disorder and brief psychotic disorder. These disorders are of shorter duration than schizophrenia as specified in Criterion C, which requires 6 months of symptoms. In schizophreniform disorder, the disturbance is present less than 6 months, and in brief psychotic disorder, symptoms are present at least 1 day but less than 1 month. Delusional disorder. Delusional disorder can be distinguished from schizophrenia by the absence of the other symptoms characteristic of schizophrenia (e. g. , delusions, prominent auditory or visual hallucinations, disorganized speech, grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior, negative symptoms). Schizotypal personality disorder. Schizotypal personality disorder may be distinguished from schizophrenia by subthreshold symptoms that are associated with persistent personality features. Obsessive-compulsive disorder and body dysmorphic disorder. Individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder and body dysmorphic disorder may present with poor or absent insight, and the preoccupations may reach delusional proportions. But these disorders are distinguished from schizophrenia by their prominent obsessions, compulsions, preoccupations with appearance or body odor, hoarding, or body-focused repetitive behaviors. Posttraumatic stress disorder. Posttraumatic stress disorder may include flashbacks that have a hallucinatory quality, and hypervigilance may reach paranoid proportions. But a trau- matic event and characteristic symptom features relating to reliving or reacting to the event are required to make the diagnosis. Autism spectrum disorder or communication disorders. These disorders may also have symptoms resembling a psychotic episode but are distinguished by their respective deficits in social interaction with repetitive and restricted behaviors and other cognitive and communication deficits. An individual v^ith autism spectrum disorder or communication disorder must have symptoms that meet full criteria for schizophrenia, w^ith prominent hallucinations or delusions for at least 1 month, in order to be diagnosed with schizophrenia as a comorbid condition. Other mental disorders associated with a psychotic episode. The diagnosis of schizophrenia is made only when the psychotic episode is persistent and not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance or another medical condition. Individuals with a delirium or major or minor neurocognitive disorder may present with psychotic symptoms, but these would have a temporal relationship to the onset of cognitive changes consistent with those disorders. Individuals with substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder may present with symptoms characteristic of Criterion A for schizophrenia, but the substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder can usually be distinguished by the chronological relationship of substance use to the onset and remission of the psychosis in the absence of substance use. Comorbidity: Rates of comorbidity with substance-related disorders are high in schizophrenia. Over half of individuals with schizophrenia have tobacco use disorder and smoke cigarettes regularly. Comorbidity with anxiety disorders is increasingly recognized in schizophrenia. Rates of obsessive-compulsive disorder and panic disorder are elevated in individuals with schizophrenia compared with the general population. Schizotypal or paranoid personality disorder may sometimes precede the onset of schizophrenia. Life expectancy is reduced in individuals with schizophrenia because of associated medical conditions. Weight gain, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular and pulmonary disease are more common in schizophrenia than in the general population. Poor engagement in health maintenance behaviors (e. g. , cancer screening, exercise) increases the risk of chronic disease, but other disorder factors, including medications, lifestyle, cigarette smoking, and diet, may also play a role. A shared vulnerability for psychosis and medical disorders may explain some of the medical comorbidity of schizophrenia\nRelationship To Other Classifications:.", "Disorder: Schizoaffective Disorder\nICD-9: 295. 70, ICD-10: Variable\nNotes: Coded as F25. 0 in ICD-10 if a manic episode is part of the presentation. Major depressive episodes may also occur; Coded as F25. 1 if only major depressive episodes are part of the presentation\nDiagnostic Criteria:\n  A: An uninterrupted period of illness during which there is a major mood episode (major depressive or manic) concurrent with Criterion A of schizophrenia. Note: The major depressive episode must include Criterion A1 : Depressed mood. B: Delusions or hallucinations for 2 or more weeks in the absence of a major mood episode (depressive or manic) during the lifetime duration of the illness\n  C: Symptoms that meet criteria for a major mood episode are present for the majority of the total duration of the active and residual portions of the illness. D: The disturbance is not attributable to the effects of a substance (e. g. , a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition\nDisorder Id: 27\nDiagnostic Features: The diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder is based on the assessment of an uninterrupted period of illness during which the individual continues to display active or residual symptoms of psychotic illness. The diagnosis is usually, but not necessarily, made during the period of psychotic illness. At some time during the period. Criterion A for schizophrenia has to be met. Criteria B (social dysfunction) and F (exclusion of autism spectrum disorder or other commimication disorder of childhood onset) for schizophrenia do not have to be met. In addition to meeting Criterion A for schizophrenia, there is a major mood episode (major depressive or manic) (Criterion A for schizoaffective disorder). Because loss of interest or pleasure is common in schizophrenia, to meet Criterion A for schizoaffective disorder, the major depressive episode must include pervasive depressed mood (i. e. , the presence of markedly diminished interest or pleasure is not sufficient). Episodes of depression or mania are present for the majority of the total duration of the illness (i. e. , after Criterion A has been met) (Criterion C for schizoaffective disorder). To separate schizoaffective disorder from a depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features, delusions or hallucinations must be present for at least 2 w^eeks in the absence of a major mood episode (depressive or manic) at some point during the lifetime duration of the illness (Criterion B for schizoaffective disorder). The symptoms must not be attributable to the effects of a substance or another medical condition (Criterion D for schizoaffective disorder). Criterion C for schizoaffective disorder specifies that mood symptoms meeting criteria for a major mood episode must be present for the majority of the total duration of the active and residual portion of the illness. Criterion C requires the assessment of mood symptoms for the entire course of a psychotic illness, which differs from the criterion in DSM-IV, which required only an assessment of the current period of illness. If the mood symptoms are present for only a relatively brief period, the diagnosis is schizophrenia, not schizoaffective disorder. When deciding whether an individual's presentation meets Criterion C, the clinician should review the total duration of psychotic illness (i. e. , both active and residual symptoms) and determine when significant mood symptoms (untreated or in need of treatment with antidepressant and/or mood-stabilizing medication) accompanied the psychotic symptoms. This determination requires sufficient historical information and clinical judgment. For example, an individual with a 4-year history of active and residual symptoms of schizophrenia develops depressive and manic episodes that, taken together, do not occupy more than 1 year during the 4-year history of psychotic illness. This presentation would not meet Criterion C. In addition to the five symptom domain areas identified in the diagnostic criteria, the assessment of cognition, depression, and mania symptom domains is vital for making critically important distinctions between the various schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders. Recording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis: Occupational functioning is frequently impaired, but this is not a defining criterion (in contrast to schizophrenia). Restricted social contact and difficulties with self-care are associated with schizoaffective disorder, but negative symptoms may be less severe and less persistent than those seen in schizophrenia. Anosognosia (i. e. , poor insight) is also common in schizoaffective disorder, but the deficits in insight may be less severe and pervasive than those in schizophrenia. Individuals with schizoaffective disorder may be at increased risk for later developing episodes of major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder if mood symptoms continue following the remission of symptoms meeting Criterion A for schizophrenia. There may be associated alcohol and other substance-related disorders. There are no tests or biological measures that can assist in making the diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder. Whether schizoaffective disorder differs from schizophrenia with regard to associated features such as structural or functional brain abnormalities, cognitive deficits, or genetic risk factors is not clear\nPrevalence: Schizoaffective disorder appears to be about one-third as common as schizophrenia. Lifetime prevalence of schizoaffective disorder is estimated to be 0. 3%. The incidence of schizoaffective disorder is higher in females than in males, mainly due to an increased incidence of the depressive type among females\nDevelopment And Course: The typical age at onset of schizoaffective disorder is early adulthood, although onset can occur anywhere from adolescence to late in life. A significant number of individuals diagnosed with another psychotic illness initially will receive the diagnosis schizoaffective disorder later when the pattern of mood episodes has become more apparent. With the current diagnostic Criterion C, it is expected that the diagnosis for some individuals will convert from schizoaffective disorder to another disorder as mood symptoms become less prominent. The prognosis for schizoaffective disorder is somewhat better than the prognosis for schizophrenia but worse than the prognosis for mood disorders. Schizoaffective disorder may occur in a variety of temporal patterns. The following is a typical pattern: An individual may have pronounced auditory hallucinations and persecutory delusions for 2 months before the onset of a prominent major depressive episode. The psychotic symptoms and the full major depressive episode are then present for 3 months. Then, the individual recovers completely from the major depressive episode, but the psychotic symptoms persist for another month before they too disappear. During this period of illness, the individual's symptoms concurrently met criteria for a major depressive episode and Criterion A for schizophrenia, and during this same period of illness, auditory hallucinations and delusions were present both before and after the depressive phase. The total period of illness lasted for about 6 months, with psychotic symptoms alone present during the initial 2 months, both depressive and psychotic symptoms present during the next 3 months, and psychotic symptoms alone present during the last month. In this instance, the duration of the depressive episode was not brief relative to the total duration of the psychotic disturbance, and thus the presentation qualifies for a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder. The expression of psychotic symptoms across the lifespan is variable. Depressive or manic symptoms can occur before the onset of psychosis, during acute psychotic episodes, during residual periods, and after cessation of psychosis. For example, an individual might present with prominent mood symptoms during the prodromal stage of schizophrenia. This pattern is not necessarily indicative of schizoaffective disorder, since it is the co-occurrence of psychotic and mood symptoms that is diagnostic. For an individual with symptoms that clearly meet the criteria for schizoaffective disorder but who on further follow-up only presents with residual psychotic symptoms (such as subthreshold psychosis and/or prominent negative symptoms), the diagnosis may be changed to schizophrenia, as the total proportion of psychotic illness compared with mood symptoms becomes more prominent. Schizoaffective disorder, bipolar type, may be more common in young adults, whereas schizoaffective disorder, depressive type, may be more common in older adults. Risk And Prognostic Factors: Genetic and physiological. Among individuals with schizophrenia, there may be an increased risk for schizoaffective disorder in first-degree relatives. The risk for schizoaffective disorder may be increased among individuals who have a first-degree relative with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or schizoaffective disorder\nCulture Related Diagnostic Issues: Cultural and socioeconomic factors must be considered, particularly when the individual and the clinician do not share the same cultural and economic background. Ideas that appear to be delusional in one culture (e. g. , witchcraft) may be commonly held in another. There is also some evidence in the literature for the overdiagnosis of schizophrenia com\u00ad pared with schizoaffective disorder in African American and Hispanic populations, so care must be tal^en to ensure a culturally appropriate evaluation that includes both psychotic and affective symptoms\nGender Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nSuicide Risk: The lifetime risk of suicide for schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder is 5%, and the presence of depressive symptoms is correlated w^ith a higher risk for suicide. There is evidence that suicide rates are higher in North American populations than in European, Eastern European, South American, and Indian populations of individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. Functional Consequences: Schizoaffective disorder is associated with social and occupational dysfunction, but dysfunction is not a diagnostic criterion (as it is for schizophrenia), and there is substantial variability between individuals diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. Diagnostic Markers:  \nDifferential Diagnosis: Other mental disorders and medical conditions. A wide variety of psychiatric and medical conditions can manifest with psychotic and mood symptoms that must be considered in the differential diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder. These include psychotic disorder due to another medical condition; delirium; major neurocognitive disorder; substance/ medication-induced psychotic disorder or neurocognitive disorder; bipolar disorders with psychotic features; major depressive disorder with psychotic features; depressive or bipolar disorders with catatonic features; schizotypal, schizoid, or paranoid personality disorder; brief psychotic disorder; schizophreniform disorder; schizophrenia; delusional disorder; and other specified and unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders. Medical conditions and substance use can present with a combination of psychotic and mood symptoms, and thus psychotic disorder due to another medical condition needs to be excluded. Distinguishing schizoaffective disorder from schizophrenia and from depressive and bipolar disorders with psychotic features is often difficult. Criterion C is designed to separate schizoaffective disorder from schizophrenia, and Criterion B is designed to distinguish schizoaffective disorder from a depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features. More specifically, schizoaffective disorder can be distinguished from a depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features due to the presence of prominent delusions and/or hallucinations for at least 2 weeks in the absence of a major mood episode. In contrast, in depressive or bipolar disorders with psychotic features, the psychotic features primarily occur during the mood episode(s). Because the relative proportion of mood to psychotic symptoms may change over time, the appropriate diagnosis may change from and to schizoaffective disorder (e. g. , a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder for a severe and prominent major depressive episode lasting 3 months during the first 6 months of a persistent psychotic illness would be changed to schizophrenia if active psychotic or prominent residual symptoms persist over several years without a recurrence of another mood episode). Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition. Other medical conditions and substance use can manifest with a combination of psychotic and mood symptoms, and thus psychotic disorder due to another medical condition needs to be excluded. Schizophrenia, bipolar, and depressive disorders. Distinguishing schizoaffective disorder from schizophrenia and from depressive and bipolar disorders with psychotic features is often difficult. Criterion C is designed to separate schizoaffective disorder from schizophrenia, and Criterion B is designed to distinguish schizoaffective disorder from a depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features. More specifically, schizoaffective disorder can be distinguished from a depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features based on the presence of prominent delusions and/or hallucinations for at least 2 weeks in the absence of a major mood episode. In contrast, in depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features, the psychotic features primarily occur during the mood episode(s). Because the relative proportion of mood to psychotic symptoms may change over time, the appropriate diagnosis may change from and to schizoaffective disorder. (For example, a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder for a severe and prominent major depressive episode lasting 3 months during the first 6 months of a chronic psychotic illness would be changed to schizophrenia if active psychotic or prominent residual symptoms persist over several years without a recurrence of another mood episode. )\nComorbidity: Many individuals diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder are also diagnosed with other mental disorders, especially substance use disorders and anxiety disorders. Similarly, the incidence of medical conditions is increased above base rate for the general population and leads to decreased life expectancy.

Disorder Id: 28\nDiagnostic Features: The essential features of substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder are prominent delusions and/or hallucinations (Criterion A) that are judged to be due to the physiological effects of a substance/medication (i. e. , a drug of abuse, a medication, or a toxin exposure) (Criterion B). Hallucinations that the individual realizes are substance/medicationinduced are not included here and instead would be diagnosed as substance intoxication or substance withdrawal with the accompanying specifier \"with perceptual disturbances\" (applies to alcohpl withdrawal; cannabis intoxication; sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic withdrawal; and stimulant intoxication). A substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder is distinguished from a primary psychotic disorder by considering the onset, course, and other factors. For drugs of abuse, there must be evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings of substance use, intoxication, or withdrawal. Substance/medication-induced psychotic disorders arise during or soon after exposure to a medication or after substance intoxication or withdrawal but can persist for weeks, whereas primary psychotic disorders may precede the onset of substance/medication use or may occur during times of sustained abstinence. Once initiated, the psychotic symptoms may continue as long as the substance/ medication use continues. Another consideration is the presence of features that are atypical of a primary psychotic disorder (e. g. , atypical age at onset or course). For example, the appearance of delusions de novo in a person older than 35 years without a known history of a primary psychotic disorder should suggest the possibility of a substance/medicationinduced psychotic disorder. Even a prior history of a primary psychotic disorder does not rule out the possibility of a substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder. In contrast, factors that suggest that the psychotic symptoms are better accounted for by a primary psychotic disorder include persistence of psychotic symptoms for a substantial period of time (i. e. , a month or more) after the end of substance intoxication or acute substance withdrawal or after cessation of medication use; or a history of prior recurrent primary psychotic disorders. Other causes of psychotic symptoms must be considered even in an individual with substance intoxication or withdrawal, because substance use problems are not uncommon among individuals with non-substance/medication-induced psychotic disorders. In addition to the four symptom domain areas identified in the diagnostic criteria, the assessment of cognition, depression, and mania symptom domains is vital for making critically important distinctions between the various schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders. Recording Procedures: ICD-9-CM. The name of the substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder begins with the specific substance (e. g. , cocaine, dexamethasone) that is presumed to be causing the delusions or hallucinations. The diagnostic code is selected from the table included in the criteria set, which is based on the drug class. For substances that do not fit into any of the classes (e. g. , dexamethasone), the code for ''other substance\" should be used; and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of substance is unknown, the category \"unknown substance\" should be used. The name of the disorder is followed by the specification of onset (i. e. , onset during intoxication, onset during withdrawal). Unlike the recording procedures for ICD-IO-CM, which combine the substance-induced disorder and substance use disorder into a single code, for ICD-9-CM a separate diagnostic code is given for the substance use disorder. For example, in the case of delusions occurring during intoxication in a man with a severe cocaine use disorder, the diagnosis is 292. 9 cocaine-induced psychotic disorder, with onset during intoxication. An additional diagnosis of 304. 20 severe cocaine use disorder is also given. When more than one substance is judged to play a significant role in the development of psychotic symptoms, each should be listed separately (e. g. , 292. 9 cannabis-induced psychotic disorder with onset during intoxication, with severe cannabis use disorder; 292. 9 phencyclidine-induced psychotic disorder, with onset during intoxication, with mild phencyclidine use disorder). ICD-10-CM. The name of the substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder begins with the specific substance (e. g. , cocaine, dexamethasone) that is presumed to be causing the delusions or hallucinations. The diagnostic code is selected from the table included in the criteria set, which is based on the drug class and presence or absence of a comorbid substance use disorder. For substances that do not fit into any of the classes (e. g. , dexamethasone), the code for \"other substance\" with no comorbid substance use should be used; and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of substance is unknown, the category \"unknown substance\" with no comorbid substance use should be used. When recording the name of the disorder, the comorbid substance use disorder (if any) is listed first, followed by the word \"with,\" followed by the name of the substance-induced psychotic disorder, followed by the specification of onset (i. e. , onset during intoxication, onset during withdrawal). For example, in the case of delusions occurring during intoxication in a man with a severe cocaine use disorder, the diagnosis is F14. 259 severe cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced psychotic disorder, with onset during intoxication. A separate diagnosis of the comorbid severe cocaine use disorder is not given. If the substance-induced psychotic disorder occurs without a comorbid substance use disorder (e. g. , after a one-time heavy use of the substance), no accompanying substance use disorder is noted (e. g. , F16. 959 phencyclidine-induced psychotic disorder, with onset during intoxication). When more than one substance is judged to play a significant role in the development of psychotic symptoms, each should be listed separately (e. g. , F12. 259 severe cannabis use disorder with cannabis-induced psychotic disorder, with onset during intoxication; F16. 159 mild phencyclidine use disorder with phencyclidine-induced psychotic disorder, with onset during intoxication). Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis: Psychotic disorders can occur in association with intoxication with the following classes of substances: alcohol; cannabis; hallucinogens, including phencyclidine and related substances; inhalants; sedatives, hypnotics, and anxiolytics; stimulants (including cocaine); and other (or unknown) substances. Psychotic disorders can occur in association with withdrawal from the following classes of substances: alcohol; sedatives, hypnotics, and anxiolytics; and other (or unknown) substances. Some of the medications reported to evoke psychotic symptoms include anesthetics and analgesics, anticholinergic agents, anticonvulsants, antihistamines, antihypertensive and cardiovascular medications, antimicrobial medications, antiparkinsonian medications, chemotherapeutic agents (e. g. , cyclosporine, procarbazine), corticosteroids, gastrointestinal medications, muscle relaxants, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications, other over-the-counter medications (e. g. , phenylephrine, pseudoephedrine), antidepressant medication, and disulfiram. Toxins reported to induce psychotic symptoms include anticholinesterase, organophosphate insecticides, sarin and other nerve gases, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and volatile substances such as fuel or paint. Prevalence: Prevalence of substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder in the general population is unknown. Between 7% and 25% of individuals presenting with a first episode of psychosis in different settings are reported to have substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder\nDevelopment And Course: The initiation of the disorder may vary considerably with the substance. For example, smoking a high dose of cocaine may produce psychosis within minutes, whereas days or weeks of high-dose alcohol or sedative use may be required to produce psychosis. Alcohol-induced psychotic disorder, with hallucinations, usually occurs only after prolonged, heavy ingestion of alcohol in individuals who have moderate to severe alcohol use disorder, and the hallucinations are generally auditory in nature. Psychotic disorders induced by amphetamine and cocaine share similar clinical features. Persecutory delusions may rapidly develop shortly after use of amphetamine or a similarly acting sympathomimetic. The hallucination of bugs or vermin crawling in or under the skin (formication) can lead to scratching and extensive skin excoriations. Cannabisinduced psychotic disorder may develop shortly after high-dose cannabis use and usually involves persecutory delusions, marked anxiety, emotional lability, and depersonalization. The disorder usually remits within a day but in some cases may persist for a few days. Substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder may at times persist when the offending agent is removed, such that it may be difficult initially to distinguish it from an independent psychotic disorder. Agents such as amphetamines, phencyclidine, and cocaine have been reported to evoke temporary psychotic states that can sometimes persist for weeks or longer despite removal of the agent and treatment with neuroleptic medication. In later life, polypharmacy for medical conditions and exposure to medications for parkinsonism, cardiovascular disease, and other medical disorders may be associated with a greater likelihood of psychosis induced by prescription medications as opposed to substances of abuse. Risk And Prognostic Factors:  \nCulture Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nGender Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nSuicide Risk:  \nFunctional Consequences: Substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder is typically severely disabling and consequently is observed most frequently in emergency rooms, as individuals are often brought to the acute-care setting when it occurs. However, the disability is typically selflimited and resolves upon removal of the offending agent. Diagnostic Markers: With substances for which relevant blood levels are available (e. g. , blood alcohol level, other quantifiable blood levels such as digoxin), the presence of a level consistent with toxicity may increase diagnostic certainty. Differential Diagnosis: Substance intoxication or substance withdrawal. Individuals intoxicated with stimulants, cannabis, the opioid meperidine, or phencyclidine, or those withdrawing from alcohol or sedatives, may experience altered perceptions that they recognize as drug effects. If reality testing for these experiences remains intact (i. e. , the individual recognizes that the perception is substance induced and neither believes in nor acts on it), the diagnosis is not substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder. Instead, substance intoxication or substance withdrawal, with perceptual disturbances, is diagnosed (e. g. , cocaine intoxication, with perceptual disturbances). \"Flashback\" hallucinations that can occur long after the use of hallucinogens has stopped are diagnosed as hallucinogen persisting perception disorder. If substance/medication-induced psychotic symptoms occur exclusively during the course of a delirium, as in severe forms of alcohol withdrawal, the psychotic symptoms are considered to be an associated feature of the delirium and are not diagnosed separately. Delusions in the context of a major or mild neurocognitive disorder would be diagnosed as major or mild neurocognitive disorder, with behavioral disturbance. Primary psychotic disorder. A substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder is distinguished from a primary psychotic disorder, such as schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, delusional disorder, brief psychotic disorder, other specified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder, or unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder, by the fact that a substance is judged to be etiologically related to the symptoms. Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition. A substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder due to a prescribed treatment for a mental or medical condition must have its onset while the individual is receiving the medication (or during withdrawal, if there is a withdrawal syndrome associated with the medication). Because individuals with medical conditions often take medications for those conditions, the clinician must consider the possibility that the psychotic symptoms are caused by the physiological consequences of the medical condition rather than the medication, in which case psychotic disorder due to another medical condition is diagnosed. The history often provides the primary basis for such a judgment. At times, a change in the treatment for the medical condition (e. g. , medication substitution or discontinuation) may be needed to determine empirically for that individual whether the medication is the causative agent. If the clinician has ascertained that the disturbance is attributable to both a medical condition and substance/medication use, both diagnoses (i. e. , psychotic disorder due to another medical condition and substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder) may be given\nComorbidity:  \nRelationship To Other Classifications:  \nSeverity and Substance: {'pmo_id': '15', 'property_value': 'Mild

predominant symptom; 293. 82 (F06. 0) With hallucinations: If hallucinations are the predominant symptom\nDiagnostic Criteria:\n  A: Prominent hallucinations or delusions\n  B: There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings that the disturbance is the direct pathophysiological consequence of another medical condition\n  C: The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder. D: The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium\n  E: The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Disorder Id: 29\nDiagnostic Features: The essential features of psychotic disorder due to another medical condition are prominent delusions or hallucinations that are judged to be attributable to the physiological effects of another medical condition and are not better explained by another mental disorder (e. g. , the symptoms are not a psychologically mediated response to a severe medical condition, in which case a diagnosis of brief psychotic disorder, with marked stressor, would be appropriate). Hallucinations can occur in any sensory modality (i. e. , visual, olfactory, gustatory, tactile, or auditory), but certain etiological factors are likely to evoke specific hallucinatory phenomena. Olfactory hallucinations are suggestive of temporal lobe epilepsy. Hallucinations may vary from simple and unformed to highly complex and organized, depending on etiological and environmental factors. Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition is generally not diagnosed if the individual maintains reality testing for the hallucinations and appreciates that they result from the medical condition. Delusions may have a variety of themes, including somatic, grandiose, religious, and, most commonly, persecutory. On the whole, however, associations between delusions and particular medical conditions appear to be less specific than is the case for hallucinations. In determining whether the psychotic disturbance is attributable to another medical condition, the presence of a medical condition must be identified and considered to be the etiology of the psychosis through a physiological mechanism. Although there are no infallible guidelines for determining whether the relationship between the psychotic disturbance and the medical condition is etiological, several considerations provide some guidance. One consideration is the presence of a temporal association between the onset, exacerbation, or remission of the medical condition and that of the psychotic disturbance. A second consideration is the presence of features that are atypical for a psychotic disorder (e. g. , atypical age at onset or presence of visual or olfactory hallucinations). The disturbance must also be distinguished from a substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder or another mental disorder (e. g. , an adjustment disorder). Recording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis: The temporal association of the onset or exacerbation of the medical condition offers the greatest diagnostic certainty that the delusions or hallucinations are attributable to a medical condition. Additional factors may include concomitant treatments for the underlying medical condition that confer a risk for psychosis independently, such as steroid treatment for autoimmune disorders. Prevalence: Prevalence rates for psychotic disorder due to another medical condition are difficult to estimate given the wide variety of underlying medical etiologies. Lifetime prevalence has been estimated to range from 0. 21% to 0. 54%. When the prevalence findings are stratified by age group, individuals older than 65 years have a significantly greater prevalence of 0. 74% compared with those in younger age groups. Rates of psychosis also vary according to the underlying medical condition; conditions most commonly associated with psychosis include untreated endocrine and metabolic disorders, autoimmune disorders (e. g. , systemic lupus erythematosus, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor autoimmune encephalitis), or temporal lobe epilepsy. Psychosis due to epilepsy has been further differentiated into ictal, postictal, and interictal psychosis. The most common of these is postictal psychosis, observed in 2%-7. 8% of epilepsy patients. Among older individuals, there may be a higher prevalence of the disorder in females, although additional gender-related features are not clear and vary considerably with the gender distributions of the underlying medical conditions\nDevelopment And Course: Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition may be a single transient state or it may be recurrent, cycling with exacerbations and remissions of the underlying medical condition. Although treatment of the underlying medical condition often results in a resolution of the psychosis, this is not always the case, and psychotic symptoms may persist long after the medical event (e. g. , psychotic disorder due to focal brain injury). In the context of chronic conditions such as multiple sclerosis or chronic interictal psychosis of epilepsy, the psychosis may assume a long-term course. The expression of psychotic disorder due to another medical condition does not differ substantially in phenomenology depending on age at occurrence. However, older age groups have a higher prevalence of the disorder, which is most likely due to the increasing medical burden associated with advanced age and the cumulative effects of deleterious exposures and age-related processes (e. g. , atherosclerosis). The nature of the underlying medical conditions is likely to change across the lifespan, with younger age groups more affected by epilepsy, head trauma, autoimmune, and neoplastic diseases of early to midlife, and older age groups more affected by stroke disease, anoxic events, and multiple system comorbidities. Underlying factors with increasing age, such as preexisting cognitive impairment as well as vision and hearing impairments, may incur a greater risk for psychosis, possibly by serving to lower the threshold for experiencing psychosis. Risk And Prognostic Factors: Course modifiers. Identification and treatment of the underlying medical condition has the greatest impact on course, although preexisting central nervous system injury may confer a worse course outcome (e. g. , head trauma, cerebrovascular disease). Culture Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nGender Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nSuicide Risk: Suicide risk in the context of psychotic disorder due to another medical condition is not clearly delineated, although certain conditions such as epilepsy and multiple sclerosis are associated with increased rates of suicide, which may be further increased in the presence of psychosis\nFunctional Consequences: Functional disability is typically severe in the context of psychotic disorder due to another medical condition but will vary considerably by the type of condition and likely improve with successful resolution of the condition\nDiagnostic Markers: The diagnosis of psychotic disorder due to another medical condition depends on the clinical condition of each individual, and the diagnostic tests will vary according to that condition. A variety of medical conditions may cause psychotic symptoms. These include neurological conditions (e. g. , neoplasms, cerebrovascular disease, Huntington's disease, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, auditory or visual nerve injury or impairment, deafness, migraine, central nervous system infections), endocrine conditions (e. g. , hyper- and hypothyroidism, hyper- and hypoparathyroidism, hyper- and hypoadrenocorticism), metabolic conditions (e. g. , hypoxia, hypercarbia, hypoglycemia), fluid or electrolyte imbalances, hepatic or renal diseases, and autoimmune disorders with central nervous system involvement (e. g. , systemic lupus erythematosus). The associated physical examination findings, laboratory findings, and patterns of prevalence or onset reflect the etiological medical condition\nDifferential Diagnosis: Delirium. Hallucinations and delusions commonly occur in the context of a delirium; however, a separate diagnosis of psychotic disorder due to another medical condition is not given if the disturbance occurs exclusively during the course of a delirium. Delusions in the context of a major or mild neurocognitive disorder would be diagnosed as major or mild neurocognitive disorder, with behavioral disturbance. Substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder. If there is evidence of recent or prolonged substance use (including medications with psychoactive effects), withdrawal from a substance, or exposure to a toxin (e. g. , LSD [lysergic acid diethylamide] intoxication, alcohol withdrawal), a substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder should be considered. Symptoms that occur during or shortly after (i. e. , within 4 weeks) of substance intoxication or withdrawal or after medication use may be especially indicative of a substance-induced psychotic disorder, depending on the character, duration, or amount of the substance used. If the clinician has ascertained that the disturbance is due to both a medical condition and substance use, both diagnoses (i. e. , psychotic disorder due to another medical condition and substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder) can be given. Psychotic disorder. Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition must be distinguished from a psychotic disorder (e. g. , schizophrenia, delusional disorder, schizoaffective disorder) or a depressive or bipolar disorder, with psychotic features. In psychotic disorders and in depressive or bipolar disorders, with psychotic features, no specific and direct causative physiological mechanisms associated with a medical condition can be demonstrated. Late age at onset and the absence of a personal or family history of schizophrenia or delusional disorder suggest the need for a thorough assessment to rule out the diagnosis of psychotic disorder due to another medical condition. Auditory hallucinations that involve voices speaking complex sentences are more characteristic of schizophrenia than of psychotic disorder due to a medical condition. Other types of hallucinations (e. g. , visual, olfactory) commonly signal a psychotic disorder due to another medical condition or a substance/medication-induced psychotic disorder. Comorbidity: Psychotic disorder due to another medical condition in individuals older than 80 years is associated with concurrent major neurocognitive disorder (dementia)\nRelationship To Other Classifications:  \nPredominant Psychosis Symptom: {'pmo_id': '67', 'property_value': 'Delusions', 'icd_9_override': '293. 81', 'icd_10_override': 'F06. 2'}, {'pmo_id': '68', 'property_value': 'Hallucinations', 'icd_9_override': '293. 82', 'icd_10_override': 'F06. 0'}.", "Disorder: Bipolar I Disorder\nICD-9: Variable, ICD-10: Variable\nNotes: \nDiagnostic Criteria:\n  Manic Episode: Note: Criteria A-D constitute a manic episode.

'}\nDisorder Id: 35\nDiagnostic Features: The essential feature of a manic episode is a distinct period during which there is an abnormally, persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and persistently increased activity or energy that is present for most of the day, nearly every day, for a period of at least 1 week (or any duration if hospitalization is necessary), accompanied by at least three additional symptoms from Criterion B. If the mood is irritable rather than elevated or expansive, at least four Criterion B symptoms must be present. Mood in a manic episode is often described as euphoric, excessively cheerful, high, or \"feeling on top of the world. \" In some cases, the mood is of such a highly infectious quality that it is easily recognized as excessive and may be characterized by unlimited and hap-hazard enthusiasm for interpersonal, sexual, or occupational interactions. For example, the individual may spontaneously start extensive conversations with strangers in public. Often the predominant mood is irritable rather than elevated, particularly when the individual's wishes are denied or if the individual has been using substances. Rapid shifts in mood over brief periods of time may occur and are referred to as lability (i. e. , the alterna- tion among euphoria, dysphoria, and irritability). In children, happiness, silliness and \"goofiness\" are normal in the context of special occasions; however, if these symptoms are recurrent, inappropriate to the context, and beyond what is expected for the developmental level of the child, they may meet Criterion A. If the happiness is unusual for a child (i. e. , distinct from baseline), and the mood change occurs at the same time as symptoms that meet Criterion B for mania, diagnostic certainty is increased; however, the mood change must be accompanied by persistently increased activity or energy levels that are obvious to those who know the child well. During the manic episode, the individual may engage in multiple overlapping new projects. The projects are often initiated with little knowledge of the topic, and nothing seems out of the individual's reach. The increased activity levels may manifest at unusual hours of the day. Inflated self-esteem is typically present, ranging from uncritical self-confidence to marked grandiosity, and may reach delusional proportions (Criterion Bl). Despite lack of any particular experience or talent, the individual may embark on complex tasks such as writing a novel or seeing publicity for some impractical invention. Grandiose delusions (e. g. , of having a special relationship to a famous person) are common. In children, overestimation of abilities and belief that, for example, they are the best at a sport or the smartest in the class is normal; however, when such beliefs are present despite clear evidence to the contrary or the child attempts feats that are clearly dangerous and, most important, represent a change from the child's normal behavior, the grandiosity criterion should be considered satisfied. One of the most common features is a decreased need for sleep (Criterion B2) and is distinct from insomnia in which the individual wants to sleep or feels the need to sleep but is unable. The individual may sleep httle, if at all, or may awaken several hours earlier than usual, feeling rested and full of energy. When the sleep disturbance is severe, the individual may go for days without sleep, yet not feel tired. Often a decreased need for sleep heralds the onset of a manic episode. Speech can be rapid, pressured, loud, and difficult to interrupt (Criterion B3). Individuals may talk continuously and without regard for others' wishes to communicate, often in an intrusive manner or without concern for the relevance of what is said. Speech is sometimes characterized by jokes, puns, amusing irrelevancies, and theatricality, with dramatic mannerisms, singing, and excessive gesturing. Loudness and forcefulness of speech often become more important than what is conveyed. If the individual's mood is more irritable than expansive, speech may be marked by complaints, hostile comments, or angry tirades, particularly if attempts are made to interrupt the individual. Both Criterion A and Criterion B symptoms may be accompanied by symptoms of the opposite (i. e. , depressive) pole (see \"with mixed features\" specifier, pp. 149-150). Often the individual's thoughts race at a rate faster than they can be expressed through speech (Criterion B4). Frequently there is flight of ideas evidenced by a nearly continuous flow of accelerated speech, with abrupt shifts from one topic to another. When flight of ideas is severe, speech may become disorganized, incoherent, and particularly distressful to the individual. Sometimes thoughts are experienced as so crowded that it is very difficult to speak. Distractibility (Criterion B5) is evidenced by an inability to censor immaterial external stimuli (e. g. , the interviewer's attire, background noises or conversations, furnishings in the room) and often prevents individuals experiencing mania from holding a rational conversation or attending to instructions. The increase in goal-directed activity often consists of excessive planning and participation in multiple activities, including sexual, occupational, political, or religious activities. Increased sexual drive, fantasies, and behavior are often present. Individuals in a manic episode usually show increased sociability (e. g. , renewing old acquaintances or calling or contacting friends or even strangers), without regard to the intrusive, domineering, and demanding nature of these interactions. They often display psychomotor agitation or restlessness (i. e. , purposeless activity) by pacing or by holding multiple conversations simulta\u00ad neously. Some individuals write excessive letters, e-mails, text messages, and so forth, on many different topics to friends, public figures, or the media. The increased activity criterion can be difficult to ascertain in children; however, when the child takes on many tasks simultaneously, starts devising elaborate and unrealistic plans for projects, develops previously absent and developmentally inappropriate sexual preoccupations (not accounted for by sexual abuse or exposure to sexually explicit material), then Criterion B might be met based on clinical judgment. It is essential to determine whether the behavior represents a change from the child's baseline behavior; occurs most of the day, nearly every day for the requisite time period; and occurs in temporal association with other symptoms of mania. The expansive mood, excessive optimism, grandiosity, and poor judgment often lead to reckless involvement in activities such as spending sprees, giving away possessions, reckless driving, foolish business investments, and sexual promiscuity that is unusual for the individual, even though these activities are likely to have catastrophic consequences (Criterion B7). The individual may purchase many unneeded items without the money to pay for them and^ in some cases, give them away. Sexual behavior may include infidelity or indiscriminate sexual encounters with strangers, often disregarding the risk of sexually transmitted diseases or interpersonal consequences. The manic episode must result in marked impairment in social or occupational functioning or require hospitalization to prevent harm to self or others (e. g. , financial losses, illegal activities, loss of employment, self-injurious behavior). By definition, the presence of psychotic features during a manic episode also satisfies Criterion C. Manic symptoms or syndromes that are attributable to the physiological effects of a drug of abuse (e. g. , in the context of cocaine or amphetamine intoxication), the side effects of medications or treatments (e. g. , steroids, L-dopa, antidepressants, stimulants), or another medical condition do not count toward the diagnosis of bipolar I disorder. However, a fully syndromal manic episode that arises during treatment (e. g. , with medications, electroconvulsive therapy, light therapy) or drug use and persists beyond the physiological effect of the inducing agent (i. e. , after a medication is fully out of the individual's system or the effects of electroconvulsive therapy would be expected to have dissipated completely) is sufficient evidence for a manic episode diagnosis (Criterion D). Caution is indicated so that one or two symptoms (particularly increased irritability, edginess, or agitation following antidepressant use) are not taken as sufficient for diagnosis of a manic or hypomanie episode, nor necessarily an indication of a bipolar disorder diathesis. It is necessary to meet criteria for a manic episode to make a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder, but it is not required to have hypomanie or major depressive episodes. However, they may precede or follow a manic episode. Full descriptions of the diagnostic features of a hypomanie episode may be found within the text for bipolar II disorder, and the features of a major depressive episode are described within the text for major depressive disorder. Recording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis: During a manic episode, individuals often do not perceive that they are ill or in need of treatment and vehemently resist efforts to be treated. Individuals may change their dress, makeup, or personal appearance to a more sexually suggestive or flamboyant style. Some perceive a sharper sense of smell, hearing, or vision. Gambling and antisocial behaviors may accompany the manic episode. Some individuals may become hostile and physically threatening to others and, when delusional, may become physically assaultive or suicidal. Catastrophic consequences of a manic episode (e. g. , involuntary hospitalization, difficulties with the law, serious financial difficulties) often result from poor judgment, loss of insight, and hyperactivity. Mood may shift very rapidly to anger or depression. Depressive symptoms may occur during a manic episode and, if present, may last moments, hours, or, more rarely, days (see \"with mixed features\" specifier, pp. 149-150). Prevalence: The 12-month prevalence estimate in the continental United States was 0. 6% for bipolar I disorder as defined in DSM-IV. Twelve-month prevalence of bipolar I disorder across 11 countries ranged from 0. 0% to 0. 6%. The lifetime male-to-female prevalence ratio is approximately 1. 1:1\nDevelopment And Course: Mean age at onset of the first manic, hypomanie, or major depressive episode is approximately 18 years for bipolar I disorder. Special considerations are necessary to detect the diagnosis in children. Since children of the same chronological age may be at different developmental stages, it is difficult to define with precision what is ''normal\" or \"expected\" at any given point. Therefore, each child should be judged according to his or her own baseline. Onset occurs throughout the life cycle, including first onsets in the 60s or 70s. Onset of manic symptoms (e. g. , sexual or social disinhibition) in late mid-life or latelife should prompt consideration of medical conditions (e. g. , frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder) and of substance ingestion or withdrawal. More than 90% of individuals who have a single manic episode go on to have recurrent mood episodes. Approximately 60% of manic episodes occur immediately before a major depressive episode. Individuals with bipolar I disorder who have multiple (four or more) mood episodes (major depressive, manic, or hypomanie) within 1 year receive the specifier \"with rapid cycling. \"\nRisk And Prognostic Factors: Environmental. Bipolar disorder is more common in high-income than in low-income countries (1. 4 vs. 0. 7%). Separated, divorced, or widowed individuals have higher rates of bipolar I disorder than do individuals who are married or have never been married, but the direction of the association is unclear. Genetic and physiological. A family history of bipolar disorder is one of the strongest and most consistent risk factors for bipolar disorders. There is an average 10-fold increased risk among adult relatives of individuals with bipolar I and bipolar II disorders. Magnitude of risk increases with degree of kinship. Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder likely share a genetic origin, reflected in familial co-aggregation of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Course modifiers. After an individual has a manic episode with psychotic features, subsequent manic episodes are more likely to include psychotic features. Incomplete interepisode recovery is more common when the current episode is accompanied by moodincongruent psychotic features\nCulture Related Diagnostic Issues: Little information exists on specific cultural differences in the expression of bipolar I disorder. One possible explanation for this may be that diagnostic instruments are often translated and applied in different cultures with no transcultural validation. In one U. S. study, 12-month prevalence of bipolar I disorder was significantly lower for Afro-Caribbeans than for African Americans or whites. Gender Related Diagnostic Issues: Females are more likely to experience rapid cycling and mixed states, and to have patterns of comorbidity that differ from those of males, including higher rates of lifetime eating disorders. Females with bipolar I or II disorder are more likely to experience depressive symptoms than males. They also have a higher lifetime risk of alcohol use disorder than are males and a much greater likelihood of alcohol use disorder than do females in the general population. Suicide Risk: The lifetime risk of suicide in individuals with bipolar disorder is estimated to be at least 15 times that of the general population. In fact, bipolar disorder may account for one-quarter of all completed suicides. A past history of suicide attempt and percent days spent depressed in the past year are associated with greater risk of suicide attempts or completions. Functional Consequences: Although many individuals with bipolar disorder return to a fully functional level between episodes, approximately 30% show severe impairment in work role function. Functional recovery lags substantially behind recovery from symptoms, especially with respect to occupational recovery, resulting in lower socioeconomic status despite equivalent levels of education when compared with the general population. Individuals with bipolar I disorder perform more poorly than healthy individuals on cognitive tests. Cognitive impairments may contribute to vocational and interpersonal difficulties and persist through the lifespan, evex^ during euthymie periods. Diagnostic Markers:  \nDifferential Diagnosis: Major depressive disorder. Major depressive disorder may also be accompanied by hypomanie or manic symptoms (i. e. , fewer symptoms or for a shorter duration than required for mania or hypomania). When the individual presents in an episode of major depression, one must depend on corroborating history regarding past episodes of mania or hypomania. Symptoms of irritability may be associated with either major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder, adding to diagnostic complexity. Other bipolar disorders. Diagnosis of bipolar I disorder is differentiated from bipolar II disorder by determining whether there have been any past episodes of mania. Other specified and unspecified bipolar and related disorders should be differentiated from bipolar I and II disorders by considering whether either the episodes involving manic or hypomanic symptoms or the episodes of depressive symptoms fail to meet the full criteria for those conditions. Bipolar disorder due to another medical condition may be distinguished from bipolar I and II disorders by identifying, based on best clinical evidence, a causally related medical condition. Generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, or other anxiety disorders. These disorders need to be considered in the differential diagnosis as either the primary disorder or, in some cases, a comorbid disorder. A careful history of symptoms is needed to differentiate generalized anxiety disorder from bipolar disorder, as anxious ruminations may be mistaken for racing thoughts, and efforts to minimize anxious feelings may be taken as impulsive behavior. Similarly, symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder need to be differentiated from bipolar disorder. It is helpful to assess the episodic nature of the symptoms described, as well as to consider symptom triggers, in making this differential diagnosis. Substance/medication-induced bipolar disorder. Substance use disorders may manifest with substance. medication-induced manic symptoms that must be distinguished from bipolar I disorder; response to mood stabilizers during a substance/medicationinduced mania may not necessarily be diagnostic for bipolar disorder. There may be substantial overlap in view of the tendency for individuals with bipolar I disorder to overuse substances during an episode. A primary diagnosis of bipolar disorder must be established based on symptoms that remain once substances are no longer being used. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. This disorder may be misdiagnosed as bipolar disorder, especially in adolescents and children. Many symptoms overlap with the symp\u00ad toms of mania, such as rapid speech, racing thoughts, distractibihty, and less need for sleep. The \"double counting\" of symptoms toward both ADHD and bipolar disorder can be avoided if the clinician clarifies whether the symptom(s) represents a distinct episode. Personality disorders. Personality disorders such as borderline personality disorder may have substantial symptomatic overlap with bipolar disorders, since mood lability and impulsivity are common in both conditions. Symptoms must represent a distinct episode, and the noticeable increase over baseline required for the diagnosis of bipolar disorder must be present. A diagnosis of a personality disorder should not be made during an untreated mood episode. Disorders with prominent irritability. In individuals with severe irritability, particularly children and adolescents, care must be taken to apply the diagnosis of bipolar disorder only to those who have had a clear episode of mania or hypomania\u2014that is, a distinct time period, of the required duration, during which the irritability was clearly different from the individual's baseline and was accompanied by the onset of Criterion B symptoms. When a child's irritability is persistent and particularly severe, the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder would be more appropriate. Indeed, when any child is being assessed for mania, it is essential that the symptoms represent a clear change from the child's typical behavior. Comorbidity: Co-occurring mental disorders are common, with the most frequent disorders being any anxiety disorder (e. g. , panic attacks, social anxiety disorder [social phobia], specific phobia), occurring in approximately three-fourths of individuals; ADHD, any disruptive, impulse-control, or conduct disorder (e. g. , intermittent explosive disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, conduct disorder), and any substance use disorder (e. g. , alcohol use disorder) occur in over half of individuals with bipolar I disorder. Adults with bipolar I disorder have high rates of serious and/or untreated co-occurring medical conditions. Metabolic s)nidrome and migraine are more common among individuals with bipolar disorder than in the general population. More than half of individuals whose symptoms meet criteria for bipolar disorder have an alcohol use disorder, and those with both disorders are at greater risk for suicide attempt.

'}\nDisorder Id: 36\nDiagnostic Features: Bipolar II disorder is characterized by a clinical course of recurring mood episodes consisting of one or more major depressive episodes (Criteria A-C under \"Major Depressive Episode\") and at least one hypomanie episode (Criteria A-F under \"Hypomanie Episode\"). The major depressive episode must last at least 2 weeks, and the hypomar\u00fcc episode must last at least 4 days, to meet the diagnostic criteria. During the mood episode(s), the requisite number of symptoms must be present most of the day, nearly every day, and represent a noticeable change from usual behavior and functioning. The presence of a manic episode during the course of illness precludes the diagnosis of bipolar II disorder (Criterion B under \"Bipolar II Disorder\"). Episodes of substance/medication-induced depressive disorder or substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder (representing the physiological effects of a medication, other somatic treatments for depression, drugs of abuse, or toxin exposure) or of depressive and related disorder due to another medical condition or bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition do not count toward a diagnosis of bipolar II disorder unless they persist beyond the physiological effects of the treatment or substance and then meet duration criteria for an episode. In addition, the episodes must not be better accounted for by schizoaffective disorder and are not superimposed on schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, or other specified or unspecified schizophrenia spectrum or other psychotic disorders (Criterion C under \"Bipolar II Disorder\"). The depressive episodes or hypomanie fluctuations must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning (Criterion D under \"Bipolar II Disorder\"); however, for hypomanie episodes, this requirement does not have to be met. A hypomanie episode that causes significant impairment would likely qualify for the diagnosis of manic episode and, therefore, for a lifetime diagnosis of bipolar I disorder. The recurrent major depressive episodes are often more frequent and lengthier than those occurring in bipolar I disorder. Individuals with bipolar II disorder typically present to a clinician during a major depressive episode and are unlikely to complain initially of hypomania. Typically, the hypomanie episodes themselves do not cause impairment. Instead, the impairment results from the major depressive episodes or from a persistent pattern of unpredictable mood changes and fluctuating, unreliable interpersonal or occupational functioning. Individuals with bipolar II disorder may not view the hypomanie episodes as pathological or disadvantageous, although others may be troubled by the individual's erratic behavior. Clinical information from other informants, such as close friends or relatives, is often useful in establishing the diagnosis of bipolar II disorder. A hypomanie episode should not be confused with the several days of euthymia and restored energy or activity that may follow remission of a major depressive episode. Despite the substantial differences in duration and severity between a manic and hypomanie episode, bipolar II disorder is not a \"milder form\" of bipolar I disorder. Compared with individuals with bipolar I disorder, individuals with bipolar II disorder have greater chronicity of illness and spend, on average, more time in the depressive phase of their illness, which can be severe and/ or disabling. Depressive symptoms co-occurring with a hypomanie episode or hypomanie symptoms co-occurring with a depressive episode are common in individuals with bipolar \u03a0 disorder and are overrepresented in females, particularly hypomania with mixed features. Individuals experiencing hypomania with mixed features may not label their symptoms as hypomania, but instead experience them as depression with increased energy or irritability. Recording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis: A common feature of bipolar II disorder is impulsivity, which can contribute to suicide attempts and substance use disorders. Impulsivity may also stem from a concurrent personality disorder, substance use disorder, anxiety disorder, another mental disorder, or a medical condition. There may be heightened levels of creativity in some individuals with a bipolar disorder. However, that relationship may be nonlinear; that is, greater lifetime creative accomplishments have been associated with milder forms of bipolar disorder, and higher creativity has been found in unaffected family members. The individual's attachment to heightened creativity during hypomanie episodes may contribute to ambivalence about seeking treatment or undermine adherence to treatment\nPrevalence: The 12-month prevalence of bipolar II disorder, internationally, is 0. 3%. In the United States, 12-month prevalence is 0. 8%. The prevalence rate of pediatric bipolar II disorder is difficult to establish. DSM-IV bipolar I, bipolar II, and bipolar disorder not otherwise specified yield a combined prevalence rate of 1. 8% in U. S. and non-U. S. community samples, with higher rates (2. 7% inclusive) in youths age 12 years or older\nDevelopment And Course: Although bipolar II disorder can begin in late adolescence and throughout adulthood, average age at onset is the mid-20s, which is slightly later than for bipolar I disorder but earlier than for major depressive disorder. The illness most often begins with a depressive episode and is not recognized as bipolar II disorder until a hypomanie episode occurs; this happens in about 12% of individuals with the initial diagnosis of major depressive disorder. Anxiety, substance use, or eating disorders may also precede the diagnosis, complicating its detection. Many individuals experience several episodes of major depression prior to the first recognized hypomanie episode. The number of lifetime episodes (both hypomanie and major depressive episodes) tends to be higher for bipolar II disorder than for major depressive disorder or bipolar I disorder. However, individuals with bipolar I disorder are actually more likely to experience hypomanie symptoms than are individuals with bipolar II disorder. The interval between mood episodes in the course of bipolar II disorder tends to decrease as the individual ages. While the hypomanie episode is the feature that defines bipolar II disorder, depressive episodes are more enduring and disabling over time. Despite the predominance of depression, once a hypomanie episode has occurred, the diagnosis becomes bipolar II disorder and never reverts to major depressive disorder. Approximately 5%-15% of individuals with bipolar II disorder have multiple (four or more) mood episodes (hypomanie or major depressive) within the previous 12 months. If this pattern is present, it is noted by the specifier \"with rapid cycling. \" By definition, psychotic symptoms do not occur in hypomanie episodes, and they appear to be less frequent in the major depressive episodes in bipolar II disorder than in those of bipolar I disorder. Switching from a depressive episode to a manic or hypomanie episode (with or without mixed features) may occur, both spontaneously and during treatment for depression. About 5%-15% of individuals with bipolar II disorder will ultimately develop a manic episode, which changes the diagnosis to bipolar I disorder, regardless of subsequent course. Making the diagnosis in children is often a challenge, especially in those with irritability and hyperarousal that is nonepisodic (i. e. , lacks the well-demarcated periods of altered mood). Nonepisodic irritability in youth is associated with an elevated risk for anxiety disorders and major depressive disorder, but not bipolar disorder, in adulthood. Persistently irritable youths have lower familial rates of bipolar disorder than do youths who have bipolar disorder. For a hypomanie episode to be diagnosed, the child's symptoms must exceed what is expected in a given environment and culture for the child's developmental stage. Compared with adult onset of bipolar II disorder, childhood or adolescent onset of the disorder may be associated with a more severe lifetime course. The 3-year incidence rate of first-onset bipolar II disorder in adults older than 60 years is 0. 34%. However, distinguishing individuals older than 60 years with bipolar II disorder by late versus early age at onset does not appear to have any clinical utility\nRisk And Prognostic Factors: Genetic and physiological. The risk of bipolar II disorder tends to be highest among relatives of individuals with bipolar II disorder, as opposed to individuals with bipolar I disorder or major depressive disorder. There may be genetic factors influencing the age at onset for bipolar disorders. Course modifiers. A rapid-cycling pattern is associated with a poorer prognosis. Return to previous level of social function for individuals with bipolar II disorder is more likely for individuals of younger age and with less severe depression, suggesting adverse effects of prolonged illness on recovery. More education, fewer years of illness, and being married are independently associated with functional recovery in individuals with bipolar disorder, even after diagnostic type (I vs. II), current depressive symptoms, and presence of psychiatric comorbidity are taken into account. Culture Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nGender Related Diagnostic Issues: Whereas the gender ratio for bipolar I disorder is equal, findings on gender differences in bipolar II disorder are mixed, differing by type of sample (i. e. , registry, community, or clinical) and country of origin. There is little to no evidence of bipolar gender differences, whereas some, but not all, clinical samples suggest that bipolar II disorder is more common in females than in males, which may reflect gender differences in treatment seeking or other factors. Patterns of illness and comorbidity, however, seem to differ by gender, with females being more likely than males to report hypomania with mixed depressive features and a rapid-cycling course. Childbirth may be a specific trigger for a hypomanie episode, which can occur in 10%-20% of females in nonelinieal populations and most typically in the early postpartum period. Distinguishing hypomania from the elated mood and reduced sleep that normally accompany the birth of a child may be challenging. Postpartum hypomania may foreshadow the onset of a depression that occurs in about half of females who experience postpartum \"highs. \" Accurate detection of bipolar II disorder may help in establishing appropriate treatment of the depression, which may reduce the risk of suicide and infanticide. Suicide Risk: Suicide risk is high in bipolar II disorder. Approximately one-third of individuals with bipolar II disorder report a lifetime history of suicide attempt. The prevalence rates of lifetime attempted suicide in bipolar II and bipolar I disorder appear to be similar (32. 4% and 36. 3%, respectively). However, the lethality of attempts, as defined by a lower ratio of attempts to completed suicides, may be higher in individuals with bipolar II disorder compared with individuals with bipolar I disorder. There may be an association between genetic markers and increased risk for suicidal behavior in individuals with bipolar disorder, including a 6. 5-fold higher risk of suicide among first-degree relatives of bipolar II probands compared with those with bipolar I disorder. Functional Consequences: Although many individuals with bipolar II disorder return to a fully functional level between mood episodes, at least 15% continue to have some inter-episode dysfunction, and 20% transition directly into another mood episode without inter-episode recovery. Functional recovery lags substantially behind recovery from symptoms of bipolar II disorder, especially in regard to occupational recovery, resulting in lower socioeconomic status despite equivalent levels of education with the general population. Individuals with bipolar II disorder perform more poorly than healthy individuals on cognitive tests and, with the exception of memory and semantic fluency, have similar cognitive impairment as do individuals with bipolar I disorder. Cognitive impairments associated with bipolar II disorder may contribute to vocational difficulties. Prolonged unemployment in individuals with bipolar disorder is associated with more episodes of depression, older age, increased rates of current panic disorder, and lifetime history of alcohol use disorder. Diagnostic Markers:  \nDifferential Diagnosis: Major depressive disorder. Perhaps the most challenging differential diagnosis to consider is major depressive disorder, which may be accompanied by hypomanie or manic symptoms that do not meet full criteria (i. e. , either fewer symptoms or a shorter duration than required for a hypomanie episode). This is especially true in evaluating individuals with symptoms of irritability, which may be associated with either major depressive disorder or bipolar II disorder. Cyclothymic disorder. In cyclothymic disorder, there are numerous periods of hypomanic symptoms and numerous periods of depressive symptoms that do not meet symptom or duration criteria for a major depressive episode. Bipolar II disorder is distinguished from cyclothymic disorder by the presence of one or more major depressive episodes. If a major depressive episode occurs after the first 2 years of cyclothymic disorder, the additional diagnosis of bipolar II disorder is given. Schizophrenia spectrum and other related psychotic disorders. Bipolar II disorder must be distinguished from psychotic disorders (e. g. , schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, and delusional disorder). Schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and delusional disorder are all characterized by periods of psychotic symptoms that occur in the absence of prominent mood symptoms. Other helpful considerations include the accompanying symptoms, previous course, and family history. Panic disorder or other anxiety disorders. Anxiety disorders need to be considered in the differential diagnosis and may frequently be present as co-occurring disorders. Substance use disorders. Substance use disorders are included in the differential diagnosis. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may be misdiagnosed as bipolar II disorder, especially in adolescents and children. Many symptoms of ADHD, such as rapid speech, racing thoughts, distractibility, and less need for sleep, overlap with the symptoms of hypomania. The double counting of symptoms toward both ADHD and bipolar II disorder can be avoided if the clinician clarifies whether the symptoms represent a distinct episode and if the noticeable increase over baseline required for the diagnosis of bipolar II disorder is present. Personality disorders. The same convention as applies for ADHD also applies when evaluating an individual for a personality disorder such as borderline personality disorder, since mood lability and impulsivity are common in both personality disorders and bipolar II disorder. Symptoms must represent a distinct episode, and the noticeable increase over baseline required for the diagnosis of bipolar II disorder must be present. A diagnosis of a personality disorder should not be made during an untreated mood episode unless the lifetime history supports the presence of a personality disorder. Other bipolar disorders. Diagnosis of bipolar II disorder should be differentiated from bipolar I disorder by carefully considering whether there have been any past episodes of mania and from other specified and unspecified bipolar and related disorders by confirming the presence of fully syndromal hypomania and depression\nComorbidity: Bipolar II disorder is more often than not associated with one or more co-occurring mental disorders, with anxiety disorders being the most common. Approximately 60% of individuals with bipolar II disorder have three or more co-occurring mental disorders; 75% have an anxiety disorder; and 37% have a substance use disorder. Children and adolescents with bipolar II disorder have a higher rate of co-occurring anxiety disorders compared with those with bipolar I disorder, and the anxiety disorder most often predates the bipolar disorder. Anxiety and substance use disorders occur in individuals with bipolar II disorder at a higher rate than in the general population. Approximately 14% of individuals with bipolar II disorder have at least one lifetime eating disorder, with binge-eating disorder being more common than bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa. These commonly co-occurring disorders do not seem to follow a course of illness that is truly independent from that of the bipolar disorder, but rather have strong associations with mood states. For example, anxiety and eating disorders tend to associate most with depressive symptoms, and substance use disorders are moderately associated with manic symptoms\nRelationship To Other Classifications:.", "Disorder: Cyclothymic Disorder\nICD-9: 301. 13, ICD-10: F34. 0\nNotes: \nDiagnostic Criteria:\n  A: For at least 2 years (at least 1 year in children and adolescents) there have been numerous periods with hypomania symptoms that do not meet criteria for a hypomania episode and numerous periods with depressive symptoms that do not meet criteria for a major depressive episode\n  B: During the above 2-year period (1 year in children and adolescents), the hypomania and depressive periods have been present for at least half the time and the individual has not been without the symptoms for more than 2 months at a time\n  C: Criteria for a major depressive, manic, or hypomania episode have never been met\n  D: The symptoms in Criterion A are not better explained by schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, or other specified or unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder\n  E: The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e. g. , a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition (e. g. , hyperthyroidism)\n  F: The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning\nDisorder Id: 37\nDiagnostic Features: The essential feature of cyclothymic disorder is a chronic, fluctuating mood disturbance involving numerous periods of hypomanie symptoms and periods of depressive symptoms that are distinct from each other (Criterion A). The hypomanie symptoms are of insufficient number, severity, pervasiveness, or duration to meet full criteria for a hypomanic episode, and the depressive symptoms are of insufficient number, severity, pervasiveness, or duration to meet full criteria for a major depressive episode. During the initial 2-year period (1 year for children or adolescents), the symptoms must be persistent (present more days than not), and any symptom-free intervals last no longer than 2 months (Criterion B). The diagnosis of cyclothymic disorder is made only if the criteria for a major depressive, manic, or hypomanie episode have never been met (Criterion C). If an individual with cyclothymic disorder subsequently (i. e. , after the initial 2 years in adults or 1 year in children or adolescents) experiences a major depressive, manic, or hypomanie episode, the diagnosis changes to major depressive disorder, bipolar I disorder, or other specified or unspecified bipolar and related disorder (subclassified as hypomanie episode without prior major depressive episode), respectively, and the cyclothymic disorder diagnosis is dropped. The cyclothymic disorder diagnosis is not made if the pattern of mood swings is better explained by schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, or other specified and unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders (Criterion D), in which ease the mood symptoms are considered associated features of the psychotic disorder. The mood disturbance must also not be attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e. g. , a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition (e. g. , hyperthyroidism) (Criterion E). Although some individuals may function particularly well during some of the periods of hypomania, over the prolonged course of the disorder, there must be clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning as a result of the mood disturbance (Criterion F). The impairment may develop as a result of prolonged periods of cyclical, often unpredictable mood changes (e. g. , the individual may be regarded as temperamental, moody, unpredictable, inconsistent, or unreliable). Recording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis:  \nPrevalence: The lifetime prevalence of cyclothymic disorder is approximately 0. 4%-l%. Prevalence in mood disorders clinics may range from 3% to 5%. In the general population, cyclothymic disorder is apparently equally common in males and females. In clinical settings, females with cyclothymic disorder may be more likely to present for treatment than males. Development And Course: Cyclothymic disorder usually begins in adolescence or early adult life and is sometimes considered to reflect a temperamental predisposition to other disorders in this chapter. Cyclothymic disorder usually has an insidious onset and a persistent course. There is a 15%-50% risk that an individual with cyclothymic disorder will subsequently develop bipolar I disorder or bipolar II disorder. Onset of persistent, fluctuating hypomanie and depressive symptoms late in adult life needs to be clearly differentiated from bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition and depressive disorder due to another medical condition (e. g. , multiple sclerosis) before the cyclothymic disorder diagnosis is assigned. Among children with cyclothymic disorder, the mean age at onset of symptoms is 6. 5 years of age\nRisk And Prognostic Factors: Genetic and physiological. Major depressive disorder, bipolar I disorder, and bipolar II disorder are more common among first-degree biological relatives of individuals with cyclothymic disorder than in the general population. There may also be an increased familial risk of substance-related disorders. Cyclotiiymic disorder may be more common in the first-degree biological relatives of individuals witiK bipolar I disorder than in the general population\nCulture Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nGender Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nSuicide Risk:  \nFunctional Consequences:  \nDiagnostic Markers:  \nDifferential Diagnosis: Bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition and depressive disorder due to another medical condition. The diagnosis of bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition or depressive disorder due to another medical condition is made when the mood disturbance is judged to be attributable to the physiological effect of a specific, usually chronic medical condition (e. g. , hyperthyroidism). This determination is based on the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings. If it is judged that the hypomanie and depressive symptoms are not the physiological consequence of the medical condition, then the primary mental disorder (i. e. , cyclothymic disorder) and the medical condition are coded. For example, this would be the case if the mood symptoms are considered to be the psychological (not the physiological) consequence of having a chronic medical condition, or if there is no etiological relationship between the hypomanie and depressive symptoms and the medical condition. Substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder and substance/medication-induced depressive disorder. Substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder and substance/medication-induced depressive disorder are distinguished from cyclothymic disorder by the judgment that a substance/medication (especially stimulants) is etiologically related to the mood disturbance. The frequent mood swings in these disorders that are suggestive of cyclothymic disorder usually resolve following cessation of substance/medication use. Bipolar I disorder, with rapid cycling, and bipolar II disorder, with rapid cycling. Both disorders may resemble cyclothymic disorder by virtue of the frequent marked shifts in mood. By definition, in cyclothymic disorder the criteria for a major depressive, manic, or hypomanie episode has never been met, whereas the bipolar I disorder and bipolar II disorder specifier \"with rapid cycling\" requires that full mood episodes be present. Borderline personality disorder. Borderline personality disorder is associated with marked shifts in mood that may suggest cyclothymic disorder. If the criteria are met for both disorders, both borderline personality disorder and cyclothymic disorder may be diagnosed\nComorbidity: Substance-related disorders and sleep disorders (i. e. , difficulties in initiating and maintaining sleep) may be present in individuals with cyclothymic disorder. Most children with cyclothymic disorder treated in outpatient psychiatric settings have comorbid mental conditions; they are more likely than other pediatric patients with mental disorders to have comorbid attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Relationship To Other Classifications:.", "Disorder: Substance/Medication-Induced Bipolar and Related Disorder\nICD-9: Variable, ICD-10: Variable\nNotes: \nDiagnostic Criteria:\n  A: A prominent and persistent disturbance in mood that predominates in the clinical picture and is characterized by elevated, expansive, or irritable mood, with or without depressed mood, or markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities\n  B: There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings of both (1)and (2):\n    - {'dccd_id': '153', 'dcc_id': '112', 'parent_dccd_id': '0', 'dccd_key': '1', 'dccd_value': 'The symptoms in Criterion A developed during or soon after substance intoxication or withdrawal or after exposure to a medication. '}\n    - {'dccd_id': '154', 'dcc_id': '112', 'parent_dccd_id': '0', 'dccd_key': '2', 'dccd_value': 'The involved substance/medication is capable of producing the symptoms in Criterion A'}\n  C: The disturbance is not better explained by a bipolar or related disorder that is not substance/medication-induced. Such evidence of an independent bipolar or related disorder could include the following:\n    - {'dccd_id': '155', 'dcc_id': '113', 'parent_dccd_id': '0', 'dccd_key': 'i. e. ,', 'dccd_value': 'The symptoms precede the onset of the substance/medication use; the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time (e. g. , about 1 month) after the cessation of acute withdrawal or severe intoxication; or there is other evidence suggesting the existence of an independent non-substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder (e. g. , a history of recurrent non-substance/medication-related episodes). '}\n  D: The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium\n  E: The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning\nDisorder Id: 38\nDiagnostic Features: The diagnostic features of substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder are essentially the same as those for mania, hypomania, or depression. A key exception to the diagnosis of substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder is the case of hypomania or mania that occurs after antidepressant medication use or other treatments and persists beyond the physiological effects of the medication. This condition is considered an indicator of true bipolar disorder, not substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder. Similarly, individuals with apparent electroconvulsive therapy-induced manic or hypomanie episodes that persist beyond the physiological effects of the treatment are diagnosed with bipolar disorder, not substance/medication-induced bipolar ^ d related disorder. Side effects of some antidepressants and other psychotropic drugs (e. g. , edginess, agitation) may resemble the primary symptoms of a manic syndrome, but they are fundamentally distinct from bipolar symptoms and are insufficient for the diagnosis. That is, the criterion symptoms of mania/hypomania have specificity (simple agitation is not the same as excess involvement in purposeful activities), and a sufficient number of symptoms must be present (not just one or two symptoms) to make these diagnoses. In particular, the appearance of one or two nonspecific sjonptoms\u2014irritability, edginess, or agitation during antidepressant treatment\u2014in the absence of a full manic or hypomanie syndrome should not be taken to support a diagnosis of a bipolar disorder. Recording Procedures: ICD-9-CM. The name of the substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder begins with the specific substance (e. g. , cocaine, dexamethasone) that is presumed to be causing the bipolar mood symptoms. The diagnostic code is selected from the table included in the criteria set, which is based on the drug class. For substances that do not fit into any of the classes (e. g. , dexamethasone), the code for \"other substance\" should be used; and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of substance is unknown, the category \"unknown substance\" should be used. The name of the disorder is followed by the specification of onset (i. e. , onset during intoxication, onset during withdrawal). Unlike the recording procedures for ICD-IO-CM, which combine the substance-induced disorder and substance use disorder into a single code, for ICD-9-CM a separate diagnostic code is given for the substance use disorder. For example, in the case of irritable symptoms occurring during intoxication in a man with a severe cocaine use disorder, the diagnosis is 292. 84 cocaine-induced bipolar and related disorder, with onset during intoxication. An additional diagnosis of 304. 20 severe cocaine use disorder is also given. When more than one substance is judged to play a significant role in the development of bipolar mood symptoms, each should be listed separately (e. g. , 292. 84 methylphenidate-induced bipolar and related disorder, with onset during intoxication; 292. 84 dexamethasone-induced bipolar and related disorder, with onset during intoxication). ICD-10-CM. The name of the substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder begins with the specific substance (e. g. , cocaine, dexamethasone) that is presumed to be causing the bipolar mood symptoms. The diagnostic code is selected from the table included in the criteria set, which is based on the drug class and presence or absence of a comorbid substance use disorder. For substances that do not fit into any of the classes (e. g. , dexamethasone), the code for \"other substance\" should be used; and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of substance is unknown, the category \"unknown substance\" should be used. When recording the name of the disorder, the comorbid substance use disorder (if any) is listed first, followed by the word \"with,\" followed by the name of the substance-induced bipolar and related disorder, followed by the specification of onset (i. e. , onset during intoxication, onset during withdrawal). For example, in the case of irritable symptoms occurring during intoxication in a man with a severe cocaine use disorder, the diagnosis is F14. 24 severe cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced bipolar and related disorder, with onset during intoxication. A separate diagnosis of the comorbid severe cocaine use disorder is not given. If the substance-induced bipolar and related disorder occurs without a comorbid substance use disorder (e. g. , after a one-time heavy use of the substance), no accompanying substance use disorder is noted (e. g. , F15. 94 amphetamine-induced bipolar and related disorder, with onset during intoxication). When more than one substance is judged to play a significant role in the development of bipolar mood symptoms, each should be listed separately (e. g. , F15. 24 severe methylphenidate use disorder with methylphenidate-induced bipolar and related disorder, with onset during intoxication; F19. 94 dexamethasone-induced bipolar and related disorder, with onset during intoxication). Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis: Etiology (causally related to the use of psychotropic medications or substances of abuse based on best clinical evidence) is the key variable in this etiologically specified form of bipolar disorder. Substances/medications that are typically considered to be associated with substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder include the stimulant class of drugs, as well as phencyclidine and steroids; however, a number of potential substances continue to emerge as new compounds are synthesized (e. g. , so-called bath salts). A history of such substance use may help increase diagnostic certainty. Prevalence: There are no epidemiological studies of substance/medication-induced mania or bipolar disorder. Each etiological substance may have its own individual risk of inducing a bipolar (manic/hypomanie) disorder. Development And Course: In phencyclidine-induced mania, the initial presentation may be one of a delirium with affective features, which then becomes an atypically appearing manic or mixed manic state. This condition follows the ingestion or inhalation quickly, usually within hours or, at the most, a few day\u00e2^ In stimulant-induced manic or hypomanie states, the response is in minutes to 1 hour after one or several ingestions or injections. The episode is very brief and typically resolves over 1-2 days. With corticosteroids and some immunosuppressant medications, the mania (or mixed or depressed state) usually follows several days of ingestion, and the higher doses appear to have a much greater likelihood of producing bipolar symptoms\nRisk And Prognostic Factors:  \nCulture Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nGender Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nSuicide Risk:  \nFunctional Consequences:  \nDiagnostic Markers: Determination of the substance of use can be made through markers in the blood or urine to corroborate diagnosis. Differential Diagnosis: Substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder should be differentiated from other bipolar disorders, substance intoxication or substance-induced delirium, and medication side effects (as noted earlier). A full manic episode that emerges during antidepressant treatment (e. g. , medication, electroconvulsive therapy) but persists at a fully syndromal level beyond the physiological effect of that treatment is sufficient evidence for a bipolar I diagnosis. A full hypomanie episode that emerges during antidepressant treatment (e. g. , medication, electroconvulsive therapy) but persists at a fully syndromal level beyond the physiological effect of that treatment is sufficient evidence for a bipolar II diagnosis only if preceded by a major depressive episode. Comorbidity: Comorbidities are those associated with the use of illicit substances (in the case of illegal stimulants or phencyclidine) or diversion of prescribed stimulants. Comorbidities related to steroid or immunosuppressant medications are those medical indications for these preparations. Delirium can occur before or along with manic symptoms in individuals ingesting phencyclidine or those who are prescribed steroid medications or other immunosuppressant medications\nRelationship To Other Classifications:  \nSeverity and Substance: {'pmo_id': '15', 'property_value': 'Mild use disorder of Alcohol', 'icd_9_override': '291. 89', 'icd_10_override': 'F10. 14'}, {'pmo_id': '18', 'property_value': 'Mild use disorder of Phencyclidine', 'icd_9_override': '292. 84', 'icd_10_override': 'F16. 14'}, {'pmo_id': '19', 'property_value': 'Mild use disorder of Other Hallucinogen', 'icd_9_override': '292. 84', 'icd_10_override': 'F16. 14'}, {'pmo_id': '22', 'property_value': 'Mild use disorder of Sedative, hypnotic or anxiolytic', 'icd_9_override': '292. 84', 'icd_10_override': 'F13. 14'}, {'pmo_id': '23', 'property_value': 'Mild use disorder of Amphetamine (or other stimulant)', 'icd_9_override': '292. 84', 'icd_10_override': 'F15. 14'}, {'pmo_id': '24', 'property_value': 'Mild use disorder of Cocaine', 'icd_9_override': '292. 84', 'icd_10_override': 'F14. 14'}, {'pmo_id': '25', 'property_value': 'Mild use disorder of Other (or unknown) substance', 'icd_9_override': '292. 84', 'icd_10_override': 'F19. 14'}, {'pmo_id': '26', 'property_value': 'Moderate use disorder of Alcohol', 'icd_9_override': '291. 89', 'icd_10_override': 'F10. 24'}, {'pmo_id': '29', 'property_value': 'Moderate use disorder of Phencyclidine', 'icd_9_override': '292. 84', 'icd_10_override': 'F16. 24'}, {'pmo_id': '30', 'property_value': 'Moderate use disorder of Other Hallucinogen', 'icd_9_override': '292. 84', 'icd_10_override': 'F16. 24'}, {'pmo_id': '33', 'property_value': 'Moderate use disorder of Sedative, hypnotic or anxiolytic', 'icd_9_override': '292. 84', 'icd_10_override': 'F13. 24'}, {'pmo_id': '34', 'property_value': 'Moderate use disorder of Amphetamine (or other stimulant)', 'icd_9_override': '292. 84', 'icd_10_override': 'F15. 24'}, {'pmo_id': '35', 'property_value': 'Moderate use disorder of Cocaine', 'icd_9_override': '292. 84', 'icd_10_override': 'F14. 24'}, {'pmo_id': '36', 'property_value': 'Moderate use disorder of Other (or unknown) substance', 'icd_9_override': '292. 84', 'icd_10_override': 'F19. 24'}, {'pmo_id': '37', 'property_value': 'Severe use disorder of Alcohol', 'icd_9_override': '291. 89', 'icd_10_override': 'F10. 24'}, {'pmo_id': '40', 'property_value': 'Severe use disorder of Phencyclidine', 'icd_9_override': '292. 84', 'icd_10_override': 'F16. 24'}, {'pmo_id': '41', 'property_value': 'Severe use disorder of Other Hallucinogen', 'icd_9_override': '292. 84', 'icd_10_override': 'F16. 24'}, {'pmo_id': '44', 'property_value': 'Severe use disorder of Sedative, hypnotic or anxiolytic', 'icd_9_override': '292. 84', 'icd_10_override': 'F13. 24'}, {'pmo_id': '45', 'property_value': 'Severe use disorder of Amphetamine (or other stimulant)', 'icd_9_override': '292. 84', 'icd_10_override': 'F15. 24'}, {'pmo_id': '46', 'property_value': 'Severe use disorder of Cocaine', 'icd_9_override': '292. 84', 'icd_10_override': 'F14. 24'}, {'pmo_id': '47', 'property_value': 'Severe use disorder of Other (or unknown) substance', 'icd_9_override': '292. 84', 'icd_10_override': 'F19. 24'}, {'pmo_id': '48', 'property_value': 'Alcohol, without use disorder', 'icd_9_override': '291. 89', 'icd_10_override': 'F10. 94'}, {'pmo_id': '51', 'property_value': 'Phencyclidine, without use disorder', 'icd_9_override': '292. 84', 'icd_10_override': 'F16. 94'}, {'pmo_id': '52', 'property_value': 'Other Hallucinogen, without use disorder', 'icd_9_override': '292. 84', 'icd_10_override': 'F16. 94'}, {'pmo_id': '55', 'property_value': 'Sedative, hypnotic or anxiolytic, without use disorder', 'icd_9_override': '292. 84', 'icd_10_override': 'F13. 94'}, {'pmo_id': '56', 'property_value': 'Amphetamine (or other stimulant), without use disorder', 'icd_9_override': '292. 84', 'icd_10_override': 'F15. 94'}, {'pmo_id': '57', 'property_value': 'Cocaine, without use disorder', 'icd_9_override': '292. 84', 'icd_10_override': 'F14. 94'}, {'pmo_id': '58', 'property_value': 'Other (or unknown) substance, without use disorder', 'icd_9_override': '292. 84', 'icd_10_override': 'F19. 94'}.", "Disorder: Bipolar and Related Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition\nICD-9: 293. 83, ICD-10: Variable\nNotes: \nDiagnostic Criteria:\n  A: A prominent and persistent period of abnormally elevated, expansive, or irritable mood and abnormally increased activity or energy that predominates in the clinical picture.

In most cases the manic or hypomanie picture may appear during the initial presentation of the medical condition (i. e. , within 1 month); however, there are exceptions, especially in chronic medical conditions that might worsen or relapse and herald the appearance of the manic or hypomanie picture. Bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition would not be diagnosed when the manic or hypomanie episodes definitely preceded the medical condition, since the proper diagnosis would be bipolar disorder (except in the unusual circumstance in which all preceding manic or hypomanie episodes\u2014or, when only one such episode has occurred, the preceding manic or hypomanie episode\u2014were associated with ingestion of a substance/medication). The diagnosis of bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition should not be made during the course of a delirium (Criterion D). The manic or hypomanie episode in bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning to qualify for this diagnosis (Criterion E)\nRecording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis: Etiology (i. e. , a causal relationship to another medical condition based on best clinical evidence) is the key variable in this etiologically specified form of bipolar disorder. The listing of medical conditions that are said to be able to induce mania is never complete, and the clinician's best judgment is the essence of this diagnosis. Among the best known of the medical conditions that can cause a bipolar manic or hypomanie condition are Cushing's disease and multiple sclerosis, as well as stroke and traumatic brain injuries\nPrevalence:  \nDevelopment And Course: Bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition usually has its onset acutely or subacutely within the first weeks or month of the onset of the associated medical condition. However, this is not always the case, as a worsening or later relapse of the associated medical condition may precede the onset of the manic or hypomanie syndrome. The clinician must make a clinical judgment in these situations about whether the medical condition is causative, based on temporal sequence as well as plausibility of a causal relation\u00ad ship. Finally, the condition may remit before or just after the medical condition remits, particularly wh^n treatment of the manic/hypomanie symptoms is effective. Risk And Prognostic Factors:  \nCulture Related Diagnostic Issues: Culture-related differences, to the extent that there is any evidence, pertain to those associated with the medical condition (e. g. , rates of multiple sclerosis and stroke vary around the world based on dietary, genetic factors, and other environmental factors). Gender Related Diagnostic Issues: Gender differences pertain to those associated with the medical condition (e. g. , systemic lupus erythematosus is more common in females; stroke is somewhat more common in middle-age males compared with females). Suicide Risk:  \nFunctional Consequences: Functional consequences of the bipolar symptoms may exacerbate impairments associated with the medical condition and may incur worse outcomes due to interference with medical treatment. In general, it is believed, but not established, that the illness, when induced by Cushing's disease, will not recur if the Cushing's disease is cured or arrested. However, it is also suggested, but not established, that mood syndromes, including depressive and manic/hypomanie ones, may be episodic (i. e. , recurring) with static brain injuries and other central nervous system diseases. Diagnostic Markers: Diagnostic markers pertain to those associated with the medical condition (e. g. , steroid levels in blood or urine to help corroborate the diagnosis of Cushing's disease, which can be associated with manic or depressive syndromes; laboratory tests confirming the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis). Differential Diagnosis: Symptoms of delirium, catatonia, and acute anxiety. It is important to differentiate symptoms of mania from excited or hypervigilant delirious symptoms; from excited catatonic symptoms; and from agitation related to acute anxiety states. Medication-induced depressive or manic symptoms. An important differential diagnostic observation is that the other medical condition may be treated with medications (e. g. , steroids or alpha-interferon) that can induce depressive or manic symptoms. In these cases, clinical judgment using all of the evidence in hand is the best way to try to separate the most likely and/or the most important of two etiological factors (i. e. , association with the medical condition vs. a substance/medication-induced syndrome). The differential diagnosis of the associated medical conditions is relevant but largely beyond the scope of the present manual. Comorbidity: Conditions comorbid with bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition are those associated with the medical conditions of etiological relevance. Delirium can occur before or along with manic symptoms in individuals with Cushing's disease.

Disorder Id: 42\nDiagnostic Features: The core feature of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is chronic, severe persistent irritabihty. This severe irritability has two prominent clinical manifestations, the first of which is frequent temper outbursts. These outbursts typically occur in response to frustration and can be verbal or behavioral (the latter in the form of aggression against property, self, or others). They must occur frequently (i. e. , on average, three or more times per week) (Criterion C) over at least 1 year in at least two settings (Criteria E and F), such as in the home and at school, and they must be developmentally inappropriate (Criterion B). The second manifestation of severe irritability consists of chronic, persistently irritable or angry mood that is present between the severe temper outbursts. This irritable or angry mood must be characteristic of the child, being present most of the day, nearly every day, and noticeable by others in the child's environment (Criterion D). The clinical presentation of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder must be carefully distinguished from presentations of other, related conditions, particularly pediatric bipolar disorder. In fact, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder was added to DSM-5 to address the considerable concern about the appropriate classification and treatment of children who present with chronic, persistent irritability relative to children who present with classic (i. e. , episodic) bipolar disorder. Some researchers view severe, non-episodic irritability as characteristic of bipolar disorder in children, although both DSM-IV and DSM-5 require that both children and adults have distinct episodes of mania or hypomania to qualify for the diagnosis of bipolar I disorder. During the latter decades of the 20th century, this contention by researchers that severe, nonepisodic irritability is a manifestation of pediatric mania coincided with an upsurge in the rates at which clinicians assigned the diagnosis of bipolar disorder to their pediatric patients. This sharp increase in rates appears to be attributable to clinicians combining at least two clinical presentations into a single category. That is, both classic, episodic presentations of mania and non-episodic presentations of severe irritability have been labeled as bipolar disorder in children. In DSM-5, the term bipolar disorder is explicitly reserved for episodic presentations of bipolar symptoms. DSM-IV did not include a diagnosis designed to capture youths whose hallmark symptoms consisted of very severe, nonepisodic irritability, whereas DSM-5, with the inclusion of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, provides a distinct category for such presentations\nRecording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis:  \nPrevalence: Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is common among children presenting to pediatric mental health clinics. Prevalence estimates of the disorder in the community are unclear. Based on rates of chronic and severe persistent irritability, which is the core feature of the disorder, the overall 6-month to 1-year period-prevalence of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder among children and adolescents probably falls in the 2%-5% range. However, rates are expected to be higher in males and school-age children than in females and adolescents\nDevelopment And Course: The onset of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder must be before age 10 years, and the diagnosis should not be applied to children with a developmental age of less than 6 years. It is unknown whether the condition presents only in this age-delimited fashion. Because the symptoms of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder are likely to change as children mature, use of the diagnosis should be restricted to age groups similar to those in which validity has been established (7-18 years). Approximately half of children with severe, chronic irritability will have a presentation that continues to meet criteria for the condition 1 year later. Rates of conversion from severe, nonepisodic irritability to bipolar disorder are very low. Instead, children with chronic irritability are at risk to develop unipolar depressive and/or anxiety disorders in adulthood. Age-related variations also differentiate classic bipolar disorder and disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. Rates of bipolar disorder generally are very low prior to adolescence (<1%), with a steady increase into early adulthood (l%-2% prevalence). Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is more common than bipolar disorder prior to adolescence, and symptoms of the condition generally become less common as children transition into adulthood. Risk And Prognostic Factors: Temperamental. Children with chronic irritability typically exhibit complicated psychiatric histories. In such children, a relatively extensive history of chronic irritability is common, typically manifesting before full criteria for the syndrome are met. Such prediagnostic presentations may have qualified for a diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder. Many children with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder have symptoms that also meet criteria for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and for an anxiety disorder, with such diagnoses often being present from a relatively early age. For some children, the criteria for major depressive disorder may also be met. Genetic and physiological. In terms of familial aggregation and genetics, it has been suggested that children presenting with chronic, non-episodic irritability can be differentiated from children with bipolar disorder in their family-based risk. However, these two groups do not differ in familial rates of anxiety disorders, unipolar depressive disorders, or substance abuse. Compared with children with pediatric bipolar disorder or other mental illnesses, those with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder exhibit both commonalities and differences in information-processing deficits. For example, face-emotion labeling deficits, as well as perturbed decision making and cognitive control, are present in children with bipolar disorder and chronically irritable children, as well as in children with some other psychiatric conditions. There is also evidence for disorder-specific dysfunction, such as during tasks assessing attention deployment in response to emotional stimuli, which has demonstrated unique signs of dysfunction in children with chronic irritability. Culture Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nGender Related Diagnostic Issues: Children presenting to clinics with features of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder are predominantly male. Among community samples, a male preponderance appears to be supported. This difference in prevalence between males and females differentiates disruptive mood dysregulation disorder from bipolar disorder, in which there is an equal gender prevalence\nSuicide Risk: In general, evidence documenting suicidal behavior and aggression, as well as other severe functional consequences, in disruptive mood dysregulation disorder should be noted when evaluating children with chronic irritability. Functional Consequences: Chronic, severe irritability, such as is seen in disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, is associated with marked disruption in a child's family and peer relationships, as well as in school performance. Because of their extremely low frustration tolerance, such children generally have difficulty succeeding in school; they are often unable to participate in the activities typically enjoyed by healthy children; their family life is severely disrupted by their outbursts and irritability; and they have trouble initiating or sustaining friendships. Levels of dysfunction in children with bipolar disorder and disruptive mood dysregulation disorder are generally comparable. Both conditions cause severe disruption in the lives of the affected individual and their families. In both disruptive mood dysregulation disorder and pediatric bipolar disorder, dangerous behavior, suicidal ideation or suicide attempts, severe aggression, and psychiatric hospitalization are common\nDiagnostic Markers:  \nDifferential Diagnosis: Because chronically irritable children and adolescents typically present with complex histories, the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder must be made while considering the presence or absence of multiple other conditions. Despite the need to consider many other syndromes, differentiation of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder from bipolar disorder and oppositional defiant disorder requires particularly careful assessment. Bipolar disorders. The central feature differentiating disruptive mood dysregulation disorder and bipolar disorders in children involves the longitudinal course of the core s}nTiptoms. In children, as in adults, bipolar I disorder and bipolar \u03a0 disorder manifest as an episodic illness with discrete episodes of mood perturbation that can be differentiated from the child's typical presentation. The mood perturbation that occurs during a manic episode is distinctly different from the child's usual mood. In addition, during a manic episode, the change in mood must be accompanied by the onset, or worsening, of associated cognitive, behavioral, and physical symptoms (e. g. , distractibility, increased goal-directed activity), which are also present to a degree that is distinctly different from the child's usual baseline. Thus, in the case of a manic episode, parents (and, depending on developmental level, children) should be able to identify a distinct time period during which the child's mood and behavior were markedly different from usual. In contrast, the irritability of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is persistent and is present over many months; while it may wax and wane to a certain degree, severe irritability is characteristic of the child with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. Thus, while bipolar disorders are episodic conditions, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is not. In fact, the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder cannot be assigned to a child who has ever experienced a fuU-duration hypomanie or manic episode (irritable or euphoric) or who has ever had a manic or hypomanie episode lasting more than 1 day. Another central differentiating feature between bipolar disorders and disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is the presence of elevated or expansive mood and grandiosity. These symptoms are common features of mania but are not characteristic of disruptive m ood dysregulation disorder. Oppositional defiant disorder. While symptoms of oppositional defiant disorder typically do occur in children with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, mood symptoms of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder are relatively rare in children with oppositional defiant disorder. The key features that warrant the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder in children whose symptoms also meet criteria for oppositional defiant disorder are the presence of severe and frequently recurrent outbursts and a persistent disruption in mood between outbursts. In addition, the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder requires severe impairment in at least one setting (i. e. , home, school, or among peers) and mild to moderate impairment in a second setting. For this reason, while most children whose symptoms meet criteria for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder will also have a presentation that meets criteria for oppositional defiant disorder, the reverse is not the case. That is, in only approximately 15% of individuals with oppositional defiant disorder would criteria for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder be met. Moreover, even for children in whom criteria for both disorders are met, only the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder should be made. Finally, both the prominent mood symptoms in disruptive mood dysregulation disorder and the high risk for depressive and anxiety disorders in follow-up studies justify placement of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder among the depressive disorders in DSM-5. (Oppositional defiant disorder is included in the chapter \"Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorders. \") This reflects the more prominent mood component among individuals with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, as compared with individuals with oppositional defiant disorder. Nevertheless, it also should be noted that disruptive mood dysregulation disorder appears to carry a high risk for behavioral problems as well as mood problems. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, major depressive disorder, anxiety disorders, and autism spectrum disorder. Unlike children diagnosed with bipolar disorder or oppositional defiant disorder, a child whose symptoms meet criteria for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder also can receive a comorbid diagnosis of ADHD, major depressive disorder, and/or anxiety disorder. However, children whose irritability is present only in the context of a major depressive episode or persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) should receive one of those diagnoses rather than disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. Children with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder may have symptoms that also meet criteria for an anxiety disorder and can receive both diagnoses, but children whose irritability is manifest only in the context of exacerbation of an anxiety disorder should receive the relevant anxiety disorder diagnosis rather than disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. In addition, children with autism spectrum disorders frequently present with temper outbursts when, for example, their routines are disturbed. In that instance, the temper outbursts would be considered secondary to the autism spectrum disorder, and the child should not receive the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. Intermittent explosive disorder. Children with symptoms suggestive of intermittent explosive disorder present with instances of severe temper outbursts, much like children with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. However, unlike disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, intermittent explosive disorder does not require persistent disruption in mood between outbursts. In addition, intermittent explosive disorder requires only 3 months of active symptoms, in contrast to the 12-month requirement for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. Thus, these two diagnoses should not be made in the same child. For children with outbursts and intercurrent, persistent irritability, only the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder should be made\nComorbidity: Rates of comorbidity in disruptive mood dysregulation disorder are extremely high. It is rare to find individuals whose symptoms meet criteria for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder alone. Comorbidity between disruptive mood dysregulation disorder and other DSM-defined syndromes appears higher than for many other pediatric mental illnesses; the strongest overlap is with oppositional defiant disorder. Not only is the overall rate of comorbidity high in disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, but also the range of comorbid illnesses appears particularly diverse. These children typically present to the clinic with a wide range of disruptive behavior, mood, anxiety, and even autism spectrum symptoms and diagnoses. However, children with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder should not have symptoms that meet criteria for bipolar disorder, as in that context, only the bipolar disorder diagnosis should be made. If children have symptoms that meet criteria for oppositional defiant disorder or intermittent explosive disorder and disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, only the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder should be assigned. Also, as noted earlier, the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder should not be assigned if the symptoms occur only in an anxietyprovoking context, when the routines of a child with autism spectrum disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder are disturbed, or in the context of a major depressive episode.

Note: This exclusion does not apply if all of the manic-like or hypomanic-like episodes are substance-induced or are attributable to the physiological effects of another medical condition\nDisorder Id: 43\nDiagnostic Features: The criterion symptoms for major depressive disorder must be present nearly every day to be considered present, with the exception of weight change and suicidal ideation. Depressed mood must be present for most of the day, in addition to being present nearly every day. Often insomnia or fatigue is the presenting complaint, and failure to probe for accompanying depressive symptoms will result in underdiagnosis. Sadness may be denied at first but may be elicited through interview or inferred from facial expression and demeanor. With individuals who focus on a somatic complaint, clinicians should determine whether the distress from that complaint is associated with specific depressive symptoms. Fatigue and sleep disturbance are present in a high proportion of cases; psychomotor disturbances are much less common but are indicative of greater overall severity, as is the presence of delusional or near-delusional guilt. The essential feature of a major depressive episode is a period of at least 2 weeks during w^hich there is either depressed mood or the loss of interest or pleasure in nearly all activities (Criterion A). In children and adolescents, the mood may be irritable rather than sad. The individual must also experience at least four additional symptoms drawn from a list that includes changes in appetite or weight, sleep, and psychomotor activity; decreased energy; feelings of worthlessness or guilt; difficulty thinking, concentrating, or making decisions; or recurrent thoughts of death or suicidal ideation or suicide plans or attempts. To count toward a major depressive episode, a symptom must either be newly present or must have clearly worsened compared with the person's pre-episode status. The symptoms must persist for most of the day, nearly every day, for at least 2 consecutive weeks. The episode must be accompanied by clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. For some individuals with milder episodes, functioning may appear to be normal but requires markedly increased effort. The mood in a major depressive episode is often described by the person as depressed, sad, hopeless, discouraged, or \"down in the dumps\" (Criterion Al). In some cases, sadness may be denied at first but may subsequently be elicited by interview (e. g. , by pointing out that the individual looks as if he or she is about to cry). In some individuals who complain of feeling \"blah,\" having no feelings, or feeling anxious, the presence of a depressed mood can be inferred from the person's facial expression and demeanor. Some individuals emphasize somatic complaints (e. g. , bodily aches and pains) rather than reporting feelings of sadness. Many individuals report or exhibit increased irritability (e. g. , persistent anger, a tendency to respond to events with angry outbursts or blaming others, an exaggerated sense of frustration over minor matters). In children and adolescents, an irritable or cranky mood may develop rather than a sad or dejected mood. This presentation should be differentiated from a pattern of irritability when frustrated. Loss of interest or pleasure is nearly always present, at least to some degree. Individuals may report feeling less interested in hobbies, \"not caring anymore,\" or not feeling any enjoyment in activities that were previously considered pleasurable (Criterion A2). Family members often notice social withdrawal or neglect of pleasurable avocations (e. g. , a formerly avid golfer no longer plays, a child who used to enjoy soccer finds excuses not to practice). In some individuals, there is a significant reduction from previous levels of sexual interest or desire. Appetite change may involve either a reduction or increase. Some depressed individuals report that they have to force themselves to eat. Others may eat more and may crave specific foods (e. g. , sweets or other carbohydrates). When appetite changes are severe (in either direction), there may be a significant loss or gain in weight, or, in children, a failure to make expected weight gains may be noted (Criterion A3). Sleep disturbance may take the form of either difficulty sleeping or sleeping excessively (Criterion A4). When insomnia is present, it typically takes the form of middle insonrmia (i. e. , waking up during the night and then having difficulty returning to sleep) or terminal insomnia (i. e. , waking too early and being unable to return to sleep). Initial insomnia (i. e. , difficulty falling asleep) may also occur. Individuals who present with oversleeping (hypersomnia) may experience prolonged sleep episodes at night or increased daytime sleep. Sometimes the reason that the individual seeks treatment is for the disturbed sleep. Psychomotor changes include agitation (e. g. , the inability to sit still, pacing, handwringing; or pulling or rubbing of the skin, clothing, or other objects) or retardation (e. g. , slowed speech, thinking, and body movements; increased pauses before answering; speech that is decreased in volume, inflection, amount, or variety of content, or muteness) (Criterion A5). The psychomotor agitation or retardation must be severe enough to be observable by others and not represent merely subjective feelings. Decreased energy, tiredness, and fatigue are common (Criterion A6). A person may report sustained fatigue without physical exertion. Even the smallest tasks seem to require substantial effort. The efficiency with which tasks are accomplished may be reduced. For example, an individual may complain that washing and dressing in the morning are exhausting and take twice as long as usual. The sense of worthlessness or guilt associated with a major depressive episode may include unrealistic negative evaluations of one's worth or guilty preoccupations or ruminations over minor past failings (Criterion A7). Such individuals often misinterpret neutral or trivial day-to-day events as evidence of personal defects and have an exaggerated sense of responsibility for untoward events. The sense of worthlessness or guilt may be of delusional proportions (e. g. , an individual who is convinced that he or she is personally responsible for world poverty). Blaming oneself for being sick and for failing to meet occupational or inte\u03c6ersonal responsibilities as a result of the depression is very common and, unless delusional, is not considered sufficient to meet this criterion. Many individuals report impaired ability to think, concentrate, or make even minor decisions (Criterion A8). They may appear easily distracted or complain of memory difficulties. Those engaged in cognitively demanding pursuits are often unable to function. In children, a precipitous drop in grades may reflect poor concentration. In elderly individuals, memory difficulties may be the chief complaint and may be mistaken for early signs of a dementia (''pseudodementia\"). When the major depressive episode is successfully treated, the memory problems often fully abate. However, in some individuals, particularly elderly persons, a major depressive episode may sometimes be the initial presentation of an irreversible dementia. Thoughts of death, suicidal ideation, or suicide attempts (Criterion A9) are common. They may range from a passive wish not to awaken in the morning or a belief that others would be better off if the individual were dead, to transient but recurrent thoughts of committing suicide, to a specific suicide plan. More severely suicidal individuals may have put their affairs in order (e. g. , updated wills, settled debts), acquired needed materials (e. g. , a rope or a gun), and chosen a location and time to accomplish the suicide. Motivations for suicide may include a desire to give up in the face of perceived insurmountable obstacles, an intense wish to end what is perceived as an unending and excruciatingly painful emotional state, an inability to foresee any enjoyment in life, or the wish to not be a burden to others. The resolution of such thinking may be a more meaningful measure of diminished suicide risk than denial of further plans for suicide. The evaluation of the symptoms of a major depressive episode is especially difficult when they occur in an individual who also has a general medical condition (e. g. , cancer, stroke, myocardial infarction, diabetes, pregnancy). Some of the criterion signs and symptoms of a major depressive episode are identical to those of general medical conditions (e. g. , weight loss with untreated diabetes; fatigue with cancer; hypersomnia early in pregnancy; insonmia later in pregnancy or the postpartum). Such symptoms count toward a major depressive diagnosis except when they are clearly and fully attributable to a general medical condition. Nonvegetative symptoms of dysphoria, anhedonia, guilt or worthlessness, impaired concentration or indecision, and suicidal thoughts should be assessed with particular care in such cases. Definitions of major depressive episodes that have been modified to include only these nonvegetative symptoms appear to identify nearly the same individuals as do the full criteria. Recording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis: Major depressive disorder is associated with high mortality, much of which is accounted for by suicide; however, it is not the only cause. For example, depressed individuals admitted to nursing homes have a markedly increased likelihood of death in the first year. Individuals frequently present with tearfulness, irritability, brooding, obsessive rumination, anxiety, phobias, excessive worry over physical health, and complaints of pain (e. g. , headaches; joint, abdominal, or other pains). In children, separation anxiety may occur. Although an extensive literature exists describing neuroanatomical, neuroendocrinological, and neurophysiological correlates of major depressive disorder, no laboratory test has yielded results of sufficient sensitivity and specificity to be used as a diagnostic tool for this disorder. Until recently, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis hyperactivity had been the most extensively investigated abnormality associated v^ith major depressive episodes, and it appears to be associated with melancholia, psychotic features, and risks for eventual suicide. Molecular studies have also implicated peripheral factors, including genetic variants in neurotrophic factors and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Additionally, functional magnetic resonance imaging studies provide evidence for functional abnormalities in specific neural systems supporting emotion processing, reward seeking, and emotion regulation in adults with major depression. Prevalence: Twelve-month prevalence of major depressive disorder in the United States is approximately 7%, with marked differences by age group such that the prevalence in 18- to 29-year-old individuals is threefold higher than the prevalence in individuals age 60 years or older. Females experience 1. 5- to 3-fold higher rates than males beginning in early adolescence. Development And Course: Major depressive disorder may first appear at any age, but the likelihood of onset increases markedly with puberty. In the United States, incidence appears to peak in the 20s; however, first onset in late life is not uncommon. The course of major depressive disorder is quite variable, such that some individuals rarely, if ever, experience remission (a period of 2 or more months with no symptoms, or only one or two symptoms to no more than a mild degree), while others experience many years with few or no symptoms between discrete episodes. It is important to distinguish individuals who present for treatment during an exacerbation of a chronic depressive illness from those whose symptoms developed recently. Chronicity of depressive symptoms substantially increases the likelihood of underlying personality, anxiety, and substance use disorders and decreases the likelihood that treatment will be followed by full symptom resolution. It is therefore useful to ask individuals presenting with depressive symptoms to identify the last period of at least 2 months during which they were entirely free of depressive symptoms. Recovery typically begins within 3 months of onset for two in five individuals with major depression and within 1 year for four in five individuals. Recency of onset is a strong determinant of the likelihood of near-term recovery, and many individuals who have been depressed only for several months can be expected to recover spontaneously. Features associated with lower recovery rates, other than current episode duration, include psychotic features, prominent anxiety, personality disorders, and symptom severity. The risk of recurrence becomes progessively lower over time as the duration of remission increases. The risk is higher in individuals whose preceding episode was severe, in younger individuals, and in individuals who have already experienced multiple episodes. The persistence of even mild depressive symptoms during remission is a powerful predictor of recurrence. Many bipolar illnesses begin with one or more depressive episodes, and a substantial proportion of individuals who initially appear to have major depressive disorder will prove, in time, to instead have a bipolar disorder. This is more likely in individuals with onset of the illness in adolescence, those with psychotic features, and those with a family history of bipolar illness. The presence of a \"'with mixed features\" specifier also increases the risk for future manic or hypomanie diagnosis. Major depressive disorder, particularly with psychotic features, may also transition into schizophrenia, a change that is much more frequent than the reverse. Despite consistent differences between genders in prevalence rates for depressive disorders, there appear to be no clear differences by gender in phenomenology, course, or treatment response. Similarly, there are no clear effects of current age on the course or treatment response of major depressive disorder. Some symptom differences exist, though, such that hypersomnia and hyperphagia are more likely in younger individuals, and melancholic symptoms, particularly psychomotor disturbances, are more common in older individuals. The likelihood of suicide attempts lessens in middle and late life, although the risk of completed suicide does not. Depressions with earlier ages at onset are more familial and more likely to involve personality disturbances. The course of major depressive disorder within individuals does not generally change with aging. Mean times to recovery appear to be stable over long periods, and the likelihood of being in an episode does not generally increase or decrease with time\nRisk And Prognostic Factors: Temperamental. Neuroticism (negative affectivity) is a well-established risk factor for the onset of major depressive disorder, and high levels appear to render individuals more likely to develop depressive episodes in response to stressful life events. Environmental. Adverse childhood experiences, particularly when there are multiple experiences of diverse types, constitute a set of potent risk factors for major depressive disorder. Stressful life events are well recognized as pr\u00e9cipitants of major depressive episodes, but the presence or absence of adverse life events near the onset of episodes does not appear to provide a useful guide to prognosis or treatment selection. Genetic and physiological. First-degree family members of individuals with major depressive disorder have a risk for major depressive disorder two- to fourfold higher than that of the general population. Relative risks appear to be higher for early-onset and recurrent forms. Heritability is approximately 40%, and the personality trait neuroticism accounts for a substantial portion of this genetic liability. Course modifiers. Essentially all major nonmood disorders increase the risk of an individual developing depression. Major depressive episodes that develop against the background of another disorder often follow a more refractory course. Substance use, anxiety, and borderline personality disorders are among the most common of these, and the presenting depressive symptoms may obscure and delay their recognition. However, sustained clinical improvement in depressive symptoms may depend on the appropriate treatment of underlying illnesses. Chronic or disabling medical conditions also increase risks for major depressive episodes. Such prevalent illnesses as diabetes, morbid obesity, and cardiovascular disease are often complicated by depressive episodes, and these episodes are more likely to become chronic than are depressive episodes in medically healthy individuals\nCulture Related Diagnostic Issues: Surveys of major depressive disorder across diverse cultures have shown sevenfold differences in 12-month prevalence rates but much more consistency in female-to-male raho, mean ages at onset, and the degree to which presence of the disorder raises the likelihood of comorbid substance abuse. While these findings suggest substantial cultural differences in the expression of major depressive disorder, they do not permit simple linkages between particular cultures and the likelihood of specific symptoms. Rather, clinicians should be aware that in most countries the majority of cases of depression go unrecognized in primary care settings and that in many cultures, somatic symptoms are very likely to constitute the presenting complaint. Among the Criterion A symptoms, insomnia and loss of energy are the most uniformly reported\nGender Related Diagnostic Issues: Although the m\u00f6st reproducible finding in the epidemiology of major depressive disorder has been a higher prevalence in females, there are no clear differences between genders in symptoms, course, treatment response, or functional consequences. In w^omen, the risk for suicide attempts is higher, and the risk for suicide completion is lower. The disparity in suicide rate by gender is not as great among those with depressive disorders as it is in the population as a whole\nSuicide Risk: The possibility of suicidal behavior exists at all times during major depressive episodes. The most consistently described risk factor is a past history of suicide attempts or threats, but it should be remembered that most completed suicides are not preceded by unsuccessful attempts. Other features associated with an increased risk for completed suicide include male sex, being single or living alone, and having prominent feelings of hopelessness. The presence of borderline personality disorder markedly increases risk for future suicide attempts. Functional Consequences: Many of the functional consequences of major depressive disorder derive from individual symptoms. Impairment can be very mild, such that many of those who interact with the affected individual are unaware of depressive symptoms. Impairment may, however, range to complete incapacity such that the depressed individual is unable to attend to basic selfcare needs or is mute or catatonic. Among individuals seen in general medical settings, those with major depressive disorder have more pain and physical illness and greater decreases in physical, social, and role functioning. Diagnostic Markers:  \nDifferential Diagnosis: Manic episodes with irritable mood or mixed episodes. Major depressive episodes with prominent irritable mood may be difficult to distinguish from manic episodes with irritable mood or from mixed episodes. This distinction requires a careful clinical evaluation of the presence of manic symptoms. Mood disorder due to another medical condition. A major depressive episode is the appropriate diagnosis if the mood disturbance is not judged, based on individual history, physical examination, and laboratory findings, to be the direct pathophysiological consequence of a specific medical condition (e. g. , multiple sclerosis, stroke, hypothyroidism). Substance/medication-induced depressive or bipolar disorder. This disorder is distinguished from major depressive disorder by the fact that a substance (e. g. , a drug of abuse, a medication, a toxin) appears to be etiologically related to the mood disturbance. For example, depressed mood that occurs only in the context of withdrawal from cocaine would be diagnosed as cocaine-induced depressive disorder. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Distractibility and low frustration tolerance can occur in both attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder and a major depressive episode; if the criteria are met for both, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder may be diagnosed in addition to the mood disorder. However, the clinician must be cautious not to overdiagnose a major depressive episode in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder whose disturbance in mood is characterized by irritability rather than by sadness or loss of interest. Adjustment disorder with depressed mood. A major depressive episode that occurs in response to a psychosocial stressor is distinguished from adjustment disorder w^ith depressed mood by the fact that the full criteria for a major depressive episode are not met in adjustment disorder. Sadness. Finally, periods of sadness are inherent aspects of the human experience. These periods should not be diagnosed as a major depressive episode unless criteria are met for severity (i. e. , five out of nine symptoms), duration (i. e. , most of the day, nearly every day for at least 2 w^eeks), and clinically significant distress or impairment. The diagnosis other specified depressive disorder may be appropriate for presentations of depressed mood wiih clinically significant impairment that do not meet criteria for duration or severity\nComorbidity: Other disorders with which major depressive disorder frequently co-occurs are substancerelated disorders, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and borderline personality disorder\nRelationship To Other Classifications:  \nDepression Severity and Recurrence: {'pmo_id': '72', 'property_value': 'Mild, single episode', 'icd_9_override': '296. 21', 'icd_10_override': 'F32. 0'}, {'pmo_id': '73', 'property_value': 'Moderate, single episode', 'icd_9_override': '296. 22', 'icd_10_override': 'F32. 1'}, {'pmo_id': '74', 'property_value': 'Severe, single episode', 'icd_9_override': '296. 23', 'icd_10_override': 'F32. 2'}, {'pmo_id': '75', 'property_value': 'With psychotic features, single episode', 'icd_9_override': '296. 24', 'icd_10_override': 'F32. 3'}, {'pmo_id': '76', 'property_value': 'In partial remission, single episode', 'icd_9_override': '296. 25', 'icd_10_override': 'F32. 4'}, {'pmo_id': '77', 'property_value': 'In full remission, single episode', 'icd_9_override': '296. 26', 'icd_10_override': 'F32. 5'}, {'pmo_id': '78', 'property_value': 'Unspecified, single episode', 'icd_9_override': '296. 20', 'icd_10_override': 'F32. 9'}, {'pmo_id': '79', 'property_value': 'Mild, recurrent episode', 'icd_9_override': '296. 31', 'icd_10_override': 'F33. 0'}, {'pmo_id': '80', 'property_value': 'Moderate, recurrent episode', 'icd_9_override': '296. 32', 'icd_10_override': 'F33. 1'}, {'pmo_id': '81', 'property_value': 'Severe, recurrent episode', 'icd_9_override': '296. 33', 'icd_10_override': 'F33. 2'}, {'pmo_id': '82', 'property_value': 'With psychotic features, recurrent episode', 'icd_9_override': '296. 34', 'icd_10_override': 'F33. 3'}, {'pmo_id': '83', 'property_value': 'In partial remission, recurrent episode', 'icd_9_override': '296. 35', 'icd_10_override': 'F33. 41'}, {'pmo_id': '84', 'property_value': 'In full remission, recurrent episode', 'icd_9_override': '296. 36', 'icd_10_override': 'F33. 42'}, {'pmo_id': '85', 'property_value': 'Unspecified, recurrent episode', 'icd_9_override': '296. 30', 'icd_10_override': 'F33. 9'}.", "Disorder: Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia)\nICD-9: 300. 4, ICD-10: F34. 1\nNotes: \nDiagnostic Criteria:\n  A: Depressed mood for most of the day, for more days than not, as indicated by either subjective account or observation by others, for at least 2 years.

G: The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e. g. , a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition (e. g. hypothyroidism). H: The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Disorder Id: 44\nDiagnostic Features: The essential feature of persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) is a depressed mood that occurs for most of the day, for more days than not, for at least 2 years, or at least 1 year for children and adolescents (Criterion A). This disorder represents a consolidation of DSM-IV-defined chronic major depressive disorder and dysthymic disorder. Major depression may precede persistent depressive disorder, and major depressive episodes may occur during persistent depressive disorder. Individuals whose symptoms meet major depressive disorder criteria for 2 years should be given a diagnosis of persistent depressive disorder as well as major depressive disorder. Individuals with persistent depressive disorder describe their mood as sad or \"down in the dumps. \" During periods of depressed mood, at least two of the six symptoms from Criterion B are present. Because these symptoms have become a part of the individual's day-to-day experience, particularly in the case of early onset (e. g. , \"I've always been this way\"), they may not be reported unless the individual is directly prompted. E>uring the 2-year period (1 year for children or adolescents), any symptom-free intervals last no longer than 2 months (Criterion C). Recording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis:  \nPrevalence: Persistent depressive disorder is effectively an amalgam of DSM-IV dysthymic disorder and chronic major depressive episode. The 12-month prevalence in the United States is approximately 0. 5% for persistent depressive disorder and 1. 5% for chronic major depressive disorder. Development And Course: Persistent depressive disorder often has an early and insidious onset (i. e. , in childhood, adolescence, or early adult life) and, by definition, a chronic course. Among individuals with both persistent depressive disorder and borderline personality disorder, the covariance of the corresponding features over time suggests the operation of a common mechanism. Early onset (i. e. , before age 21 years) is associated with a higher likelihood of comorbid personality disorders and substance use disorders. When symptoms rise to the level of a major depressive episode, they are likely to subsequently revert to a lower level. However, depressive symptoms are much less likely to resolve in a given period of time in the context of persistent depressive disorder than they are in a major depressive episode\nRisk And Prognostic Factors: Temperamental. Factors predictive of poorer long-term outcome include higher levels of neuroticism (negative affectivity), greater symptom severity, poorer global functioning, and presence of anxiety disorders or conduct disorder. Environmental. Childhood risk factors include parental loss or separation. Genetic and physiological. There are no clear differences in illness development, course, or family history between DSM-IV dysthymic disorder and chronic major depressive disorder. Earlier findings pertaining to either disorder are therefore likely to apply to persistent depressive disorder. It is thus likely that individuals with persistent depressive disorder will have a higher proportion of first-degree relatives with persistent depressive disorder than do individuals with major depressive disorder, and more depressive disorders in general. A number of brain regions (e. g. , prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, amygdala, hippocampus) have been implicated in persistent depressive disorder. Possible polysomnographic abnormalities exist as well. Culture Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nGender Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nSuicide Risk:  \nFunctional Consequences: The degree to which persistent depressive disorder impacts social and occupational functioning is likely to vary widely, but effects can be as great as or greater than those of major depressive disorder\nDiagnostic Markers:  \nDifferential Diagnosis: Major depressive disorder. If there is a depressed mood plus two or more symptoms meeting criteria for a persistent depressive episode for 2 years or more, then the diagnosis of persistent depressive disorder is made. The diagnosis depends on the 2-year duration, which distinguishes it from episodes of depression that do not last 2 years. If the symptom criteria are sufficient for a diagnosis of a major depressive episode at any time during this period, then the diagnosis of major depression should be noted, but it is coded not as a separate diagnosis but rather as a specifier with the diagnosis of persistent depressive disorder. If the individual's symptoms currently meet full criteria for a major depressive episode, then the specifier of \"with intermittent major depressive episodes, with current episode\" would be made. If the major depressive episode has persisted for at least a 2-year duration and remains present, then the specifier \"with persistent major depressive episode\" is used. When full major depressive episode criteria are not currently met but there has been at least one previous episode of major depression in the context of at least 2 years of persistent depressive symptoms, then the specifier of \"with intermittent major depressive episodes, without current episode\" is used. If the individual has not experienced an episode of major depression in the last 2 years, then the specifier \"with pure dysthymic syndrome\" is used. Psychotic disorders. Depressive symptoms are a common associated feature of chronic psychotic disorders (e. g. , schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, delusional disorder). A separate diagnosis of persistent depressive disorder is not made if the symptoms occur only during the course of the psychotic disorder (including residual phases). Depressive or bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition. Persistent depressive disorder must be distinguished from a depressive or bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition. The diagnosis is depressive or bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition if the mood disturbance is judged, based on history, physical examination, or laboratory findings, to be attributable to the direct pathophysiological effects of a specific, usually chronic, medical condition (e. g. , multiple sclerosis). If it is judged that the depressive symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of another medical condition, then the primary mental disorder (e. g. , persistent depressive disorder) is recorded, and the medical condition is noted as a concomitant medical condition (e. g. , diabetes mellitus). Substance/medication-induced depressive or bipolar disorder. A substance/medication-induced depressive or bipolar and related disorder is distinguished from persistent depressive disorder when a substance (e. g. , a drug of abuse, a medication, a toxin) is judged to be etiologically related to the mood disturbance. Personality disorders. Often, there is evidence of a coexisting personality disturbance. When an individual's presentation meets the criteria for both persistent depressive disorder and a personality disorder, both diagnoses are given\nComorbidity: In comparison to individuals with major depressive disorder, those with persistent depressive disorder are at higher risk for psychiatric comorbidity in general, and for anxiety disorders and substance use disorders in particular. Early-onset persistent depressive disorder is strongly associated with DSM-IV Cluster B and C personality disorders. Relationship To Other Classifications:.", "Disorder: Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder\nICD-9: 625. 4, ICD-10: N94. 3\nNotes: \nDiagnostic Criteria:\n  A: In the majority of menstrual cycles, at least five symptoms must be present in the final week before the onset of menses, start to improve within a few days after the onset of menses, and become minimal or absent in the week postmenses\n  B: One (or more) of the following symptoms must be present:\n    - {'dccd_id': '171', 'dcc_id': '150', 'parent_dccd_id': '0', 'dccd_key': '1', 'dccd_value': 'Marked affective lability (e. g. , mood swings: feeling suddenly sad or tearful, or increased sensitivity to rejection).

(Note: The diagnosis may be made provisionally prior to this confirmation. )\n  G: The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e. g. , a drug of abuse, a medication, other treatment) or another medical condition (e. g. , hyperthyroidism\nDisorder Id: 45\nDiagnostic Features: The essential features of premenstrual dysphoric disorder are the expression of mood lability, irritability, dysphoria, and anxiety symptoms that occur repeatedly during the premenstrual phase of the cycle and remit around the onset of menses or shortly thereafter. These symptoms may be accompanied by behavioral and physical symptoms. Symptoms must have occurred in most of the menstrual cycles during the past year and must have an adverse effect on work or social functioning. The intensity and/or expressivity of the accompanying symptoms may be closely related to social and cultural background characteristics of the affected female, family perspectives, and more specific factors such as religious beliefs, social tolerance, and female gender role issues. Typically, symptoms peak around the time of the onset of menses. Although it is not uncommon for symptoms to linger into the first few days of menses, the individual must have a symptom-free period in the follicular phase after the menstrual period begins. While the core symptoms include mood and anxiety symptoms, behavioral and somatic symptoms commonly also occur. However, the presence of physical and/or behavioral symptoms in the absence of mood and/or anxious symptoms is not sufficient for a diag\u00ad nosis. Symptoms are of comparable severity (but not duration) to those of another mental disorder, such a^ a major depressive episode or generalized anxiety disorder. In order to confirm a provisional diagnosis, daily prospective symptom ratings are required for at least two symptomatic cycles\nRecording Procedures: If symptoms have not been confirmed by prospective daily ratings of at least two symptomatic cycles, \"provisional\" should be noted after the name of the diagnosis (i. e. , \"premenstrual dysphoric disorder, provisional\"). Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis: Delusions and hallucinations have been described in the late luteal phase of the menstrual cycle but are rare. The premenstrual phase has been considered by some to be a risk period for suicide. Prevalence: Twelve-month prevalence of premenstrual dysphoric disorder is between 1. 8% and 5. 8% of menstruating women. Estimates are substantially inflated if they are based on retrospective reports rather than prospective daily ratings. However, estimated prevalence based on a daily record of symptoms for 1-2 months may be less representative, as individuals with the most severe symptoms may be unable to sustain the rating process. The most rigorous estimate of premenstrual dysphoric disorder is 1. 8% for women whose symptoms meet the full criteria without functional impairment and 1. 3% for women whose symptoms meet the current criteria with functional impairment and without co-occurring symptoms from another mental disorder. Development And Course: Onset of premenstrual dysphoric disorder can occur at any point after menarche. Incidence of new cases over a 40-month follow-up period is 2. 5% (95% confidence interval = 1. 7-3. 7). Anecdotally, many individuals, as they approach menopause, report that symptoms worsen. Symptoms cease after menopause, although cyclical hormone replacement can trigger the re-expression of symptoms\nRisk And Prognostic Factors: Environmental. Environmental factors associated with the expression of premenstrual dysphoric disorder include stress, history of interpersonal trauma, seasonal changes, and sociocultural aspects of female sexual behavior in general, and female gender role in particular. Genetic and physiological. Heritability of premenstrual dysphoric disorder is unknown. However, for premenstrual symptoms, estimates for heritability range between 30% and 80%, with the most stable component of premenstrual symptoms estimated to be about 50% heritable. Course modifiers. Women who use oral contraceptives may have fewer premenstrual complaints than do women who do not use oral contraceptives. Culture Related Diagnostic Issues: Premenstrual dysphoric disorder is not a culture-bound syndrome and has been observed in individuals in the United States, Europe, India, and Asia. It is unclear as to whether rates differ by race. Nevertheless, frequency, intensity, and expressivity of symptoms and helpseeking patterns may be significantly influenced by cultural factors. Gender Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nSuicide Risk:  \nFunctional Consequences: Symptoms must be associated with clinically meaningful distress and/or an obvious and marked impairment in the ability to function socially or occupationally in the week prior to menses. Impairment in social functioning may be manifested by marital discord and problems with children, other family members, or friends. Chronic marital or job problems should not be confused with dysfunction that occurs only in association with premenstrual dysphoric disorder. Diagnostic Markers: As indicated earlier, the diagnosis of premenstrual dysphoric disorder is appropriately confirmed by 2 months of prospective symptom ratings. A number of scales, including the Daily Rating of Severity of Problems and the Visual Analogue Scales for Premenstrual Mood Symptoms, have undergone validation and are commonly used in clinical trials for premenstrual dysphoric disorder. The Premenstrual Tension Syndrome Rating Scale has a self-report and an observer version, both of v^hich have been validated and used widely to measure illness severity in women who have premenstrual dysphoric disorder\nDifferential Diagnosis: Premenstrual syndrome. Premenstrual syndrome differs from premenstrual dysphoric disorder in that a minimum of five symptoms is not required, and there is no stipulation of affective symptoms for individuals who have premenstrual syndrome. This condition may be more common than premenstrual dysphoric disorder, although the estimated prevalence of premenstrual syndrome varies. While premenstrual syndrome shares the feature of symptom expression during the premenstrual phase of the menstrual cycle, it is generally considered to be less severe than premenstrual dysphoric disorder. The presence of physical or behavioral symptoms in the premenstruum, without the required affective symptoms, likely meets criteria for premenstrual syndrome and not for premenstrual dysphoric disorder. Dysmenorrhea. Dysmenorrhea is a syndrome of painful menses, but this is distinct from a syndrome characterized by affective changes. Moreover, symptoms of dysmenorrhea begin with the onset of menses, whereas symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder, by definition, begin before the onset of menses, even if they linger into the first few days of menses. Bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia). Many women with (either naturally occurring or substance/medicationinduced) bipolar or major depressive disorder or persistent depressive disorder believe that they have premenstrual dysphoric disorder. However, when they chart symptoms, they realize that the symptoms do not follow a premenstrual pattern. Women with another mental disorder may experience chronic symptoms or intermittent symptoms that are unrelated to menstrual cycle phase. However, because the onset of menses constitutes a memorable event, they may report that symptoms occur only during the premenstruum or that symptoms worsen premenstrually. This is one of the rationales for the requirement that symptoms be confirmed by daily prospective ratings. The process of differential diagnosis, particularly if the clinician relies on retrospective symptoms only, is made more difficult because of the overlap between symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder and some other diagnoses. The overlap of symptoms is particularly salient for differentiating premenstrual dysphoric disorder from major depressive episodes, persistent depressive disorder, bipolar disorders, and borderline personality disorder. However, the rate of personality disorders is no higher in individuals with premenstrual dysphoric disorder than in those without the disorder. Use of hormonal treatments. Some women who present with moderate to severe premenstrual symptoms may be using hormonal treatments, including hormonal contraceptives. If such symptoms occur after initiation of exogenous hormone use, the symptoms may be due to the use of hormones rather than to the underlying condition of premenstrual dysphoriq disorder. If the woman stops hormones and the symptoms disappear, this is consistent with substance/medication-induced depressive disorder\nComorbidity: A major depressive episode is the most frequently reported previous disorder in individuals presenting with premenstrual dysphoric disorder. A wide range of medical (e. g. , migraine, asthma, allergies, seizure disorders) or other mental disorders (e. g. , depressive and bipolar disorders, anxiety disorders, bulimia nervosa, substance use disorders) may worsen in the premenstrual phase; however, the absence of a symptom-free period during the postmenstrual interval obviates a diagnosis of premenstrual dysphoric disorder. These conditions are better considered premenstrual exacerbation of a current mental or medical disorder. Although the diagnosis of premenstrual dysphoric disorder should not be assigned in situations in which an individual only experiences a premenstrual exacerbation of another mental or physical disorder, it can be considered in addition to the diagnosis of another mental or physical disorder if the individual experiences symptoms and changes in level of functioning that are characteristic of premenstrual dysphoric disorder and markedly different from the symptoms experienced as part of the ongoing disorder.

Such evidence of an independent depressive disorder could include the following: The symptoms preceded the onset of the substance/medication use; the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time (e. g. , about 1 month) after the cessation of acute withdrawal or severe intoxication; or there is other evidence suggesting the existence of an independent non-substance/medication-induced depressive disorder (e. g. , a history of recurrent non-substance/medication-related episodes). D: The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium. E: The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Disorder Id: 46\nDiagnostic Features: The diagnostic features of substance/medication-induced depressive disorder include the symptoms of a depressive disorder, such as major depressive disorder; however, the depressive symptoms are associated with the ingestion, injection, or inhalation of a substance (e. g. , drug of abuse, toxin, psychotropic medication, other medication), and the depressive symptoms persist beyond the expected length of physiological effects, intoxication, or withdrawal period. As evidenced by clinical history, physical examination, or laboratory findings, the relevant depressive disorder should have developed during or within 1 month after use of a substance that is capable of producing the depressive disorder (Criterion Bl). In addition, the diagnosis is not better explained by an independent depressive disorder. Evidence of an independent depressive disorder includes the depressive disorder preceded the onset of ingestion or withdrawal from the substance; the depressive disorder persists beyond a substantial period of time after the cessation of substance use; or other evidence suggests the existence of an independent non-substance/ medication-induced depressive disorder (Criterion C). This diagnosis should not be made when symptoms occur exclusively during the course of a delirium (Criterion D). The depressive disorder associated with the substance use, intoxication, or withdrawal must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning to qualify for this diagnosis (Criterion E). Some medications (e. g. , stimulants, steroids, L-dopa, antibiotics, central nervous system drugs, dermatological agents, chemotherapeutic drugs, immunological agents) can induce depressive mood disturbances. Clinical judgment is essential to determine whether the medication is truly associated with inducing the depressive disorder or whether a primary depressive disorder happened to have its onset while the person was receiving the treatment. For example, a depressive episode that developed within the first several weeks of beginning alpha-methyldopa (an antihypertensive agent) in an individual with no history of major depressive disorder would qualify for the diagnosis of medication-induced depressive disorder. In some cases, a previously established condition (e. g. , major depressive disorder, recurrent) can recur while the individual is coincidentally taking a medication that has the capacity to cause depressive symptoms (e. g. , L-dopa, oral contraceptives). In such cases, the clinician must make a judgment as to whether the medication is causative in this particular situation. A substance/medication-induced depressive disorder is distinguished from a primary depressive disorder by considering the onset, course, and other factors associated with the substance use. There must be evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings of substance use, abuse, intoxication, or withdrawal prior to the onset of the depressive disorder. The withdrawal state for some substances can be relatively protracted, and thus intense depressive symptoms can last for a long period after the cessation of substance use\nRecording Procedures: ICD-9-CM. The name of the substance/medication-induced depressive disorder begins with the specific substance (e. g. , cocaine, dexamethasone) that is presumed to be causing the depressive symptoms. The diagnostic code is selected from the table included in the criteria set, which is based on the drug class. For substances that do not fit into any of the classes (e. g. , dexamethasone), the code for ''other substance\" should be used; and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of substance is unknown, the category \"unknown substance\" should be used. The name of the disorder is followed by the specification of onset (i. e. , onset during intoxication, onset during withdrawal). Unlike the recording procedures for ICD-IO-CM, which combine the substance-induced disorder and substance use disorder into a single code, for ICD-9-CM a separate diagnostic code is given for the substance use disorder. For example, in the qase of depressive symptoms occurring during withdrawal in a man with a severe cocaine use disorder, the diagnosis is 292. 84 cocaine-induced depressive disorder, with onset during withdrawal. An additional diagnosis of 304. 20 severe cocaine use disorder is also given. When more than one substance is judged to play a significant role in the development of depressive mood symptoms, each should be listed separately (e. g. , 292. 84 methylphenidate-induced depressive disorder, with onset during withdrawal; 292. 84 dexamethasone-induced depressive disorder, with onset during intoxication). ICD-10-CM. The name of the substance/medication-induced depressive disorder begins with the specific substance (e. g. , cocaine, dexamethasone) that is presumed to be causing the depressive symptoms. The diagnostic code is selected from the table included in the criteria set, which is based on the drug class and presence or absence of a comorbid substance use disorder. For substances that do not fit into any of the classes (e. g. , dexamethasone), the code for \"other substance\" should be used; and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of substance is unknown, the category \"unknown substance\" should be used. When recording the name of the disorder, the comorbid substance use disorder (if any) is listed first, followed by the word \"with,\" followed by the name of the substance-induced depressive disorder, followed by the specification of onset (i. e. , onset during intoxication, onset during withdrawal). For example, in the case of depressive symptoms occurring during withdrawal in a man with a severe cocaine use disorder, the diagnosis is F14. 24 severe cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced depressive disorder, with onset during withdrawal. A separate diagnosis of the comorbid severe cocaine use disorder is not given. If the substance-induced depressive disorder occurs without a comorbid substance use disorder (e. g. , after a one-time heavy use of the substance), no accompanying substance use disorder is noted (e. g. , F16. 94 phencyclidine-induced depressive disorder, with onset during intoxication). When more than one substance is judged to play a significant role in the development of depressive mood symptoms, each should be listed separately (e. g. , F15. 24 severe methylphenidate use disorder with methylphenidate-induced depressive disorder, with onset during withdrawal; F19. 94 dexamethasone-induced depressive disorder, with onset during intoxication)\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis:  \nPrevalence: In a nationally representative U. S. adult population, the lifetime prevalence of substance/ medication-induced depressive disorder is 0. 26%\nDevelopment And Course: A depressive disorder associated with the use of substance (i. e. , alcohol, illicit drugs, or a prescribed treatment for a mental disorder or another medical condition) must have its onset while the individual is using the substance or during withdrawal, if there is a withdrawal syndrome associated with the substance. Most often, the depressive disorder has its onset within the first few weeks or 1 month of use of the substance. Once the substance is discontinued, the depressive symptoms usually remit within days to several weeks, depending on the half-life of the substance/medication and the presence of a withdrawal syndrome. If symptoms persist 4 weeks beyond the expected time course of withdrawal of a particular substance/medication, other causes for the depressive mood symptoms should be considered. Although there are a few prospective controlled trials examining the association of depressive symptoms with use of a medication, most reports are from postmarketing surveillance studies, retrospective observational studies, or case reports, making evidence of causality difficult to determine. Substances implicated in medication-induced depressive disorder, with varying degrees of evidence, include antiviral agents (efavirenz), cardiovascular agents (clonidine, guanethidine, methyldopa, reserpine), retinoic acid derivatives (isotretinoin), antidepressants, anticonvulsants, anti-migraine agents (triptans), antipsychotics, hormonal agents (corticosteroids, oral contraceptives, gonadotropinreleasing hormone agonists, tamoxifen), smoking cessation agents (varenicline), and immunological agents (interferon). However, other potential substances continue to emerge as new compounds are synthesized. A history of such substance use may help increase diagnostic certainty. Risk And Prognostic Factors: Temperamental. Factors that appear to increase the risk of substance/medicationinduced depressive disorder can be conceptualized as pertaining to the specific type of drug or to a group of individuals with underlying alcohol or drug use disorders. Risk fac\u00ad tors common to all drugs include history of major depressive disorder, history of druginduced depression, and psychosocial stressors. Environmental, There are also risks factors pertaining to a specific type of medication (e. g. , increased immune activation prior to treatment for hepatitis C associated with interferon-alfa-induced depression); high doses (greater than 80 mg/day prednisone-equivalents) of corticosteroids or high plasma concentrations of efavirenz; and high estrogen/ progesterone content in oral contraceptives. Course modifiers. In a representative U. S. adult population, compared with individuals with major depressive disorder who did not have a substance use disorder, individuals with substance-induced depressive disorder were more likely to be male, to be black, to have at most a high school diploma, to lack insurance, and to have lower family income. They were also more likely to report higher family history of substance use disorders and antisocial behavior, higher 12-month history of stressful life events, and a greater number of DSM-rV major depressive disorder criteria. They were more likely to report feelings of worthlessness, insomnia/hypersomnia, and thoughts of death and suicide attempts, but less likely to report depressed mood and parental loss by death before age 18 years\nCulture Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nGender Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nSuicide Risk: Drug-induced or treatment-emergent suicidality represents a marked change in thoughts and behavior from the person's baseline, is usually temporally associated with initiation of a substance, and must be distinguished from the underlying primary mental disorders. In regard to the treatment-emergent suicidality associated with antidepressants, a U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advisory committee considered meta-analyses of 99,839 participants enrolled in 372 randomized clinical trials of antidepressants in trials for mental disorders. The analyses showed that when the data were pooled across all adult age groups, there was no perceptible increased risk of suicidal behavior or ideation. However, in age-stratified analyses, the risk for patients ages 18-24 years was elevated, albeit not significantly (odds ratio [OR] = 1. 55; 95% confidence interval [Cl] = 0. 91-2. 70). The FDA meta-analyses reveal an absolute risk of suicide in patients taking investigational antidepressants of 0. 01%. In conclusion, suicide is clearly an extremely rare treatment-emergent phenomenon, but the outcome of suicide was serious enough to prompt the FDA to issue an expanded black-box warning in 2007 regarding the importance of careful monitoring of treatment-emergent suicidal ideation in patients receiving antidepressants. Functional Consequences: \nDiagnostic Markers: Determination of the substance of use can sometimes be made through laboratory assays of the suspected substance in the blood or urine to corroborate the diagnosis\nDifferential Diagnosis: Substance intoxication and withdrawal. Depressive symptoms occur commonly in substance intoxicahon and substance withdrawal, and the diagnosis of the substance-specific intoxication or withdrawal will usually suffice to categorize the symptom presentation. A diagnosis of substance-induced depressive disorder should be made instead of a diagnosis of substance intoxication or substance withdrawal when the mood symptoms are sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention. For example, dysphoric mood is a characteristic feature of cocaine withdrawal. Substance/medication-induced depressive disorder should be diagnosed instead of cocaine withdrawal only if the mood disturbance is substantially more intense or longer lasting than what is usually encountered with cocaine withdrawal and is sufficiently severe to be a separate focus of attention and treatment. Primary depressive disorder. A substance/medication-induced depressive disorder is distinguished from a primary depressive disorder by the fact that a substance is judged to be etiologically related to the symptoms, as described earlier (see section \"Development and Course\" for this disorder). Depressive disorder due to another medical condition. Because individuals with other medical conditions often take medications for those conditions, the clinician must consider the possibility that the mood symptoms are caused by the physiological consequences of the medical condition rather than the medication, in which case depressive disorder due to another medical condition is diagnosed. The history often provides \u00dcie primary basis for such a judgment. At times, a change in the treatment for the other medical condition (e. g. , medication substitution or discontinuation) may be needed to determine empirically whether the medication is the causative agent. If the clinician has ascertained that the disturbance is a function of both another medical condition and substance use or withdrawal, both diagnoses (i. e. , depressive disorder due to another medical condition and substance/medication-induced depressive disorder) may be given. When there is insufficient evidence to determine whether the depressive symptoms are associated with substance (including a medication) ingestion or withdrawal or with another medical condition or are primary (i. e. , not a function of either a substance or another medical condition), a diagnosis of other specified depressive disorder or unspecified depressive disorder would be indicated. Comorbidity: Compared with individuals with major depressive disorder and no comorbid substance use disorder, those with substance/medication-induced depressive disorder have higher rates of comorbidity with any DSM-IV mental disorder; are more likely to have specific DSM-IV disorders of pathological gambling and paranoid, histrionic, and antisocial personality disorders; and are less likely to have persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia). Compared with individuals with major depressive disorder and a comorbid substance use disorder, individuals with substance/medication-induced depressive disorder are more likely to have alcohol use disorder, any other substance use disorder, and histrionic personality disorder; however, they are less likely to have persistent depressive disorder.

Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition\nICD-9: 293. 83, ICD-10: Variable\nNotes: \nDiagnostic Criteria:\n  A: A prominent and persistent period of depressed mood or markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities that predominates in the clinical picture\n  B: There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings that the disturbance is the direct pathophysiological consequence of another medical condition\n  C: The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder (e. g. , adjustment disorder, with depressed mood, in which the stressor is a serious medical condition). D: The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium. E: The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Disorder Id: 47\nDiagnostic Features: The essential feature of depressive disorder due to another medical condition is a prominent and persistent period of depressed mood or markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities that predominates in the clinical picture (Criterion A) and that is thought to be related to the direct physiological effects of another medical condition (Criterion B). In determining whether the mood disturbance is due to a general medical condition, the clinician must first establish the presence of a general medical condition. Further, the clinician must establish that the mood disturbance is etiologically related to the general medical condition through a physiological mechanism. A careful and comprehensive assessment of multiple factors is necessary to make this judgment. Although there are no infallible guidelines for determining whether the relationship between the mood disturbance and the general medical condition is etiological, several considerations provide some guidance in this area. One consideration is the presence of a temporal association between the onset, exacerbation, or remission of the general medical condition and that of the mood disturbance. A second consideration is the presence of features that are atypical of primary Mood Disorders (e. g. , atypical age at onset or course or absence of family history). Evidence from the literature that suggests that there can be a direct association between the general medical condition in question and the development of mood symptoms can provide a useful context in the assessment of a particular situation. Recording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis: Etiology (i. e. , a causal relationship to another medical condition based on best clinical evidence) is the key variable in depressive disorder due to another medical condition. The listing of the medical conditions that are said to be able to induce major depression is never complete, and the clinician's best judgment is the essence of this diagnosis. There are clear associations, as well as some neuroanatomical correlates, of depression with stroke, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, and traumatic brain injury. Among the neuroendocrine conditions most closely associated with depression are Cushing's disease and hypothyroidism. There are numerous other conditions thought to be associated with depression, such as multiple sclerosis. However, the literature's support for a causal association is greater with some conditions, such as Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease, than with others, for which the differential diagnosis may be adjustment disorder, with depressed mood. Prevalence:  \nDevelopment And Course: Following stroke, the onset of depression appears to be very acute, occurring within 1 day or a few days of the cerebrovascular accident (CVA) in the largest case series. However, in some cases, onset of the depression is weeks to months following the CVA. In the largest series, the duration of the major depressive episode following stroke was 9-11 months on average. Similarly, in Huntington's disease the depressive state comes quite early in the course of the illness. With Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease, it often precedes the major motor impairments and cognitive impairments associated with each condition. This is more prominently the case for Huntington's disease, in which depression is considered to be the first neuropsychiatric symptom. There is some observational evidence that depression is less common as the dementia of Huntington's disease progresses\nRisk And Prognostic Factors: The risk of acute onset of a major depressive disorder following a CVA (within 1 day to a week of the event) appears to be strongly correlated with lesion location, with greatest risk associated with left frontal strokes and least risk apparently associated with right frontal lesions in those individuals who present within days of the stroke. The association with frontal regions and laterality is not observed in depressive states that occur in the 2-6 months following stroke. Culture Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nGender Related Diagnostic Issues: Gender differences pertain to those associated with the medical condition (e. g. , systemic lupus erythematosus is more common in females; stroke is somewhat more common in middle-age males compared with females)\nSuicide Risk: There are no epidemiological studies that provide evidence to differentiate the risk of suicide from a major depressive episode due to another medical condition compared with the risk from a major depressive episode in general. There are case reports of suicides in association with major depressive episodes associated with another medical condition. There is a clear association between serious medical illnesses and suicide, particularly shortly after onset or diagnosis of the illness. Thus, it would be prudent to assume that the risk of suicide for major depressive episodes associated with medical conditions is not less than that for other forms of major depressive episode, and might even be greater\nFunctional Consequences: Functional consequences pertain to those associated with the medical condition. In general, it is believed, but not established, that a major depressive episode induced by Cushing's disease will not recur if the Cushing's disease is cured or arrested. However, it is also suggested, but not established, that mood syndromes, including depressive and manic/ hypomanie ones, may be episodic (i. e. , recurring) in some individuals with static brain injuries and other central nervous system diseases. Diagnostic Markers: Diagnostic markers pertain to those associated with the medical condition (e. g. , steroid levels in blood or urine to help corroborate the diagnosis of Cushing's disease, which can be associated with manic or depressive syndromes). Differential Diagnosis: Depressive disorders not due to another medical condition. Determination of whether a medical condition accompanying a depressive disorder is causing the disorder depends on a) the absence of an episode(s) of depressive episodes prior to the onset of the medical condition, b) the probability that the associated medical condition has a potential to promote or cause a depressive disorder, and c) a course of the depressive symptoms shortly after the onset oi^ worsening of the medical condition, especially if the depressive symptoms remit near the time that the medical disorder is effectively treated or remits. Medication-induced depressive disorder. An important caveat is that some medical conditions are treated with medications (e. g. , steroids or alpha-interferon) that can induce depressive or manic symptoms. In these cases, clinical judgment, based on all the evidence in hand, is the best way to try to separate the most likely and/or the most important of two etiological factors (i. e. , association with the medical condition vs. a substance-induced syndrome). Adjustment disorders. It is important to differentiate a depressive episode from an adjustment disorder, as the onset of the medical condition is in itself a life stressor that could bring on either an adjustment disorder or an episode of major depression. The major differentiating elements are the pervasiveness the depressive picture and the number and quality of the depressive symptoms that the patient reports or demonstrates on the mental status examination. The differential diagnosis of the associated medical conditions is relevant but largely beyond the scope of the present manual. Comorbidity: Conditions comorbid with depressive disorder due to another medical condition are those associated with the medical conditions of etiological relevance. It has been noted that delirium can occur before or along with depressive symptoms in individuals with a variety of medical conditions, such as Cushing's disease. The association of anxiety symptoms, usually generalized symptoms, is common in depressive disorders, regardless of cause.

'}\n  B: The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, lasting at least 4 weeks in children and adolescents and typically 6 months or more in adults\n  C: The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, academic, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. D: The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder, such as refusing to leave home because of excessive resistance to change in autism spectrum disorder; delusions or hallucinations concerning separation in psychotic disorders; refusal to go outside without a trusted companion in agoraphobia; worries about ill health or other harm befalling significant others in generalized anxiety disorder; or concerns about having an illness in illness anxiety disorder\nDisorder Id: 50\nDiagnostic Features: The essential feature of separation anxiety disorder is excessive fear or anxiety concerning separation from home or attachment figures. The anxiety exceeds what may be expected given the person's developmental level (Criterion A). Individuals with separation anxiety disorder have symptoms that meet at least three of the following criteria: They experience recurrent excessive distress when separation from home or major attachment figures is anticipated or occurs (Criterion Al). They worry about the well-being or death of attachment figures, particularly when separated from them, and they need to know the whereabouts of their attachment figures and want to stay in touch with them (Criterion A2). They also worry about untoward events to themselves, such as getting lost, being kidnapped, or having an accident, that would keep them from ever being reunited with their major attachment figure (Criterion A3). Individuals with separation anxiety disorder are reluctant or refuse to go out by themselves because of separation fears (Criterion A4). They have persistent and excessive fear or reluctance about being alone or without major attachment figures at home or in other settings. Children with separation anxiety disorder may be unable to stay or go in a room by themselves and may display \"clinging\" behavior, staying close to or \"shadowing\" the parent around the house, or requiring someone to be with them when going to another room in the house (Criterion A5). They have persistent reluctance or refusal to go to sleep without being near a major attachment figure or to sleep away from home (Criterion A6). Children with this disorder often have difficulty at bedtime and may insist that someone stay with them until they fall asleep. During the night, they may make their way to their parents' bed (or that of a significant other, such as a sibling). Children may be reluctant or refuse to attend camp, to sleep at friends' homes, or to go on errands. Adults may be uncomfortable when traveling independently (e. g. , sleeping in a hotel room). There may be repeated nightmares in which the content expresses the in\u00ad dividual's separation anxiety (e. g. , destruction of the family through fire, murder, or other catastrophe) (Criterion A7). Physical symptoms (e. g. , headaches, abdominal complaints, nausea, vomiting) are common in children when separation from major attachment figures occurs or is anticipated (Criterion A8). Cardiovascular symptoms such as palpitations, dizziness, and feeling faint are rare in younger children but may occur in adolescents and adults. The disturbance must last for a period of at least 4 weeks in children and adolescents younger than 18 years and is typically 6 months or longer in adults (Criterion B). However, the duration criterion for adults should be used as a general guide, with allowance for some degree of flexibility. The disturbance must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, academic, occupational, or other important areas of functioning (Criterion C)\nRecording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis: When separated from major attachment figures, children with separation anxiety disorder may exhibit social withdrawal, apathy, sadness, or difficulty concentrating on work or play. Depending on their age, individuals may have fears of animals, monsters, the dark, muggers, burglars, kidnappers, car accidents, plane travel, and other situations that are perceived as presenting danger to the family or themselves. Some individuals become homesick and uncomfortable to the point of misery when away from home. Separation anxiety disorder in children may lead to school refusal, which in turn may lead to academic difficulties and social isolation. When extremely upset at the prospect of separation, children may show anger or occasionally aggression toward someone who is forcing separation. When alone, especially in the evening or the dark, young children may report unusual perceptual experiences (e. g. , seeing people peering into their room, frightening creatures reaching for them, feeling eyes staring at them). Children with this disorder may be described as demanding, intrusive, and in need of constant attention, and, as adults, may appear dependent and overprotective. The individual's excessive demands often become a source of frustration for family members, leading to resentment and conflict in the family\nPrevalence: The 12-month prevalence of separation anxiety disorder among adults in the United States is 0. 9%-1. 9%. In children, 6- to 12-month prevalence is estimated to be approximately 4%. In adolescents in the United States, the 12-month prevalence is 1. 6%. Separation anxiety disorder decreases in prevalence from childhood through adolescence and adulthood and is the most prevalent anxiety disorder in children younger than 12 years. In clinical samples of children, the disorder is equally common in males and females. In the community, the disorder is more frequent in females. Development And Course: Periods of heightened separation anxiety from attachment figures are part of normal early development and may indicate the development of secure attachment relationships (e. g. , around 1 year of age, when infants may suffer from stranger anxiety). Onset of separation anxiety disorder may be as early as preschool age and may occur at any time during childhood and more rarely in adolescence. Typically there are periods of exacerbation and remission. In some cases, both the anxiety about possible separation and the avoidance of situations involving separation from the home or nuclear family (e. g. , going away to college, moving away from attachment figures) may persist through adulthood. However, the majority of children with separation anxiety disorder are free of impairing anxiety disorders over their lifetimes. Many adults with separation anxiety disorder do not recall a childhood onset of separation anxiety disorder, although they may recall symptoms. The manifestations of separation anxiety disorder vary with age. Younger children are more reluctant to go to school or may avoid school altogether. Younger children may not express worries 6r specific fears of definite threats to parents, home, or themselves, and the anxiety is manifested only when separation is experienced. As children age, worries emerge; these are often worries about specific dangers (e. g. , accidents, kidnapping, mugging, death) or vague concerns about not being reunited with attachment figures. In adults, separation anxiety disorder may limit their ability to cope with changes in circumstances (e. g. , moving, getting married). Adults with the disorder are typically overconcemed about their offspring and spouses and experience marked discomfort when separated from them. They may also experience significant disruption in work or social experiences because of needing to continuously check on the whereabouts of a significant other. Risk And Prognostic Factors: Environmental. Separation anxiety disorder often develops after life stress, especially a loss (e. g. , the death of a relative or pet; an illness of the individual or a relative; a change of schools; parental divorce; a move to a new neighborhood; immigration; a disaster that involved periods of separation from attachment figures). In young adults, other examples of life stress include leaving the parental home, entering into a romantic relationship, and becoming a parent. Parental overprotection and intrusiveness may be associated with separation anxiety disorder. Genetic and physiological. Separation anxiety disorder in children may be heritable. Heritability was estimated at 73% in a community sample of 6-year-old twins, with higher rates in girls. Children with separation anxiety disorder display particularly enhanced sensitivity to respiratory stimulation using C02-enriched air. Culture Related Diagnostic Issues: There are cultural variations in the degree to which it is considered desirable to tolerate separation, so that demands and opportunities for separation between parents and children are avoided in some cultures. For example, there is wide variation across countries and cultures with respect to the age at which it is expected that offspring should leave the parental home. It is important to differentiate separation anxiety disorder from the high value some cultures place on strong interdependence among family members\nGender Related Diagnostic Issues: Girls manifest greater reluctance to attend or avoidance of school than boys. Indirect expression of fear of separation may be more common in males than in females, for example, by limited independent activity, reluctance to be away from home alone, or distress when spouse or offspring do things independently or when contact with spouse or offspring is not possible\nSuicide Risk: Separation anxiety disorder in children may be associated with an increased risk for suicide. In a community sample, the presence of mood disorders, anxiety disorders, or substance use has been associated with suicidal ideation and attempts. However, this association is not specific to separation anxiety disorder and is found in several anxiety disorders\nFunctional Consequences: Individuals with separation anxiety disorder often limit independent activities away from home or attachment figures (e. g. , in children, avoiding school, not going to camp, having difficulty sleeping alone; in adolescents, not going away to college; in adults, not leaving the parental home, not traveling, not working outside the home). Diagnostic Markers:  \nDifferential Diagnosis: Generalized anxiety disorder. Separation anxiety disorder is distinguished from generalized anxiety disorder in that the anxiety predominantly concerns separation from attachment figures, and if other worries occur, they do not predominate the clinical picture. Panic disorder. Threats of separation may lead to extreme anxiety and even a panic attack. In separation anxiety disorder, in contrast to panic disorder, the anxiety concerns the possibility of being away from attachment figures and worry about untoward events befalling them, rather than being incapacitated by an unexpected panic attack. Agoraphobia. Unlike individuals with agoraphobia, those with separation anxiety disorder are not anxious about being trapped or incapacitated in situations from which escape is perceived as difficult in the event of panic-like symptoms or other incapacitating symptoms. Conduct disorder. School avoidance (truancy) is common in conduct disorder, but anxiety about separation is not responsible for school absences, and the child or adolescent usually stays away from, rather than returns to, the home. Social anxiety disorder. School refusal may be due to social anxiety disorder (social phobia). In such instances, the school avoidance is due to fear of being judged negatively by others rather than to worries about being separated from the attachment figures. Posttraumatic stress disorder. Fear of separation from loved ones is common after traumatic events such as a disasters, particularly when periods of separation from loved ones were experienced during the traumatic event. In posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), the central symptoms concern intrusions about, and avoidance of, memories associated with the traumatic event itself, whereas in separation anxiety disorder, the worries and avoidance concern the well-being of attachment figures and separation from them. Illness anxiety disorder. Individuals with illness anxiety disorder worry about specific illnesses they may have, but the main concern is about the medical diagnosis itself, not about being separated from attachment figures. Bereavement. Intense yearning or longing for the deceased, intense sorrow and emotional pain, and preoccupation with the deceased or the circumstances of the death are expected responses occurring in bereavement, whereas fear of separation from other attachment figures is central in separation anxiety disorder. Depressive and bipolar disorders. These disorders may be associated with reluctance to leave home, but the main concern is not worry or fear of untoward events befalling attachment figures, but rather low motivation for engaging with the outside world. However, individuals with separation anxiety disorder may become depressed while being separated or in anticipation of separation. Oppositional defiant disorder. Children and adolescents with separation anxiety disorder may be oppositional in the context of being forced to separate from attachment figures. Oppositional defiant disorder should be considered only when there is persistent oppositional behavior unrelated to the anticipation or occurrence of separation from attachment figures. Psychotic disorders. Unlike the hallucinations in psychotic disorders, the unusual perceptual experiences that may occur in separation anxiety disorder are usually based on a misperception of an actual stimulus, occur only in certain situations (e. g. , nighttime), and are reversed by the presence of an attachment figure. Personality disorders. Dependent personality disorder is characterized by an indiscriminate tendency to rely on others, whereas separation anxiety disorder involves concern about the proximity and safety of main attachment figures. Borderline personality disorder is characterized by fear of abandonment by loved ones, but problems in identity, self-direction, interpersonal functioning, and impulsivity are additionally central to that disorder, whereas they are not central to separation anxiety disorder. Comorbidity: In children, separation anxiety disorder is highly comorbid with generahzed anxiety disorder and specific phobia. In adults, common comorbidities include specific phobia, PTSD, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and personality disorders. Depressive and bipolar disorders are also comorbid with separation anxiety disorder in adults. Relationship To Other Classifications:.", "Disorder: Selective Mutism\nICD-9: 312. 23, ICD-10: F94. 0\nNotes: \nDiagnostic Criteria:\n  A: Consistent failure to speak in specific social situations in which there is an expectation for speaking (e. g. , at school) despite speaking in other situations. B: The disturbance interferes with educational or occupational achievement or with social communication\n  C: The duration of the disturbance is at least 1 month (not limited to the first month of school). D: The failure to speak is not attributable to a lack of knowledge of, or comfort with, the spoken language required in the social situation\n  E: The disturbance is not better explained by a communication disorder (e. g. , childhood-onset fluency disorder) and does not occur exclusively during the course of autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia, or another psychotic disorder. Disorder Id: 51\nDiagnostic Features: When encountering other individuals in social interactions, children with selective mutism do not initiate speech or reciprocally respond when spoken to by others. Lack of speech occurs in social interactions with children or adults. Children with selective mutism will speak in their home in the presence of immediate family members but often not even in front of close friends or second-degree relatives, such as grandparents or cousins. The disturbance is often marked by high social anxiety. Children with selective mutism often refuse to speak at school, leading to academic or educational impairment, as teachers often find it difficult to assess skills such as reading. The lack of speech may interfere with social communication, although children with this disorder sometimes use nonspoken or nonverbal means (e. g. , grunting, pointing, writing) to communicate and may be willing or eager to perform or engage in social encounters when speech is not required (e. g. , nonverbal parts in school plays). Recording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis: Associated features of selective mutism may include excessive shyness, fear of social embarrassment, social isolation and withdrawal, clinging, compulsive traits, negativism, temper tantrums, or mild oppositional behavior. Although children with this disorder generally have normal language skills, there may occasionally be an associated commu- nication disorder, although no particular association with a specific communication disorder has been identified. Even when these disorders are present, anxiety is present as well. In clinical settings, children with selective mutism are almost always given an additional diagnosis of another anxiety disorder\u2014most commonly, social anxiety disorder (social phobia). Prevalence: Selective mutism is a relatively rare disorder and has not been included as a diagnostic category in epidemiological studies of prevalence of childhood disorders. Point prevalence using various clinic or school samples ranges between 0. 03% and 1% depending on the setting (e. g. , clinic vs. school vs. general population) and ages of the individuals in the sample. The prevalence of the disorder does not seem to vary by sex or race/ethnicity. The disorder is more likely to manifest in young children than in adolescents and adults. Development And Course: The onset of selective mutism is usually before age 5 years, but the disturbance may not come to clinical attention until entry into school, where there is an increase in social interaction and performance tasks, such as reading aloud. The persistence of the disorder is variable. Although clinical reports suggest that many individuals \"'outgrow\" selective mutism, the longitudinal course of the disorder is unknown. In some cases, particularly in individuals with social anxiety disorder, selective mutism may disappear, but symptoms of social anxiety disorder remain\nRisk And Prognostic Factors: Temperamental. Temperamental risk factors for selective mutism are not well identified. Negative affectivity (neuroticism) or behavioral inhibition may play a role, as may parental history of shyness, social isolation, and social anxiety. Children with selective mutism may have subtle receptive language difficulties compared with their peers, although receptive language is still within the normal range. Environmental. Social inhibition on the part of parents may serve as a model for social reticence and selective mutism in children. Furthermore, parents of children with selective mutism have been described as overprotective or more controlling than parents of children with other anxiety disorders or no disorder. Genetic and physiological factors. Because of the significant overlap between selective mutism and social anxiety disorder, there may be shared genetic factors between these conditions. Culture Related Diagnostic Issues: Children in families who have immigrated to a country where a different language is spoken may refuse to speak the new language because of lack of knowledge of the language. If comprehension of the new language is adequate but refusal to speak persists, a diagnosis of selective mutism may be warranted. Gender Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nSuicide Risk:  \nFunctional Consequences: Selective mutism may result in social impairment, as children may be too anxious to engage in reciprocal social interaction with other children. As children with selective mutism mature, they may face increasing social isolation. In school settings, these children may suffer academic impairment, because often they do not communicate with teachers regarding their academic or personal needs (e. g. , not understanding a class assignment, not asking to use the restroom). Severe impairment in school and social functioning, including that resulting from teasing by peers, is common. In certain instances, selective mutism may serve as a compensatory strategy to decrease anxious arousal in social encounters. Diagnostic Markers:  \nDifferential Diagnosis: Communication disorders. Selective mutism should be distinguished from speech disturbances that are better explained by a communication disorder, such as language disorder, speech sound disorder (previously phonological disorder), childhood-onset fluency disorder (stuttering), or pragmatic (social) communication disorder. Unlike selective mutism, the speech disturbance in these conditions is not restricted to a specific social situation. Neurodevelopmental disorders and schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. Individuals with an autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder, or severe intellectual disability may have problems in social communication and be unable to speak appropriately in social situations. In contrast, selective mutism should be diagnosed only when a child has an established capacity to speak in some social situations (e. g. , typically at home). Social anxiety disorder (social phobia). The social anxiety and social avoidance in social anxiety disorder may be associated with selective mutism. In such cases, both diagnoses may be given. Comorbidity: The most common comorbid conditions are other anxiety disorders, most commonly social anxiety disorder, followed by separation anxiety disorder and specific phobia. Oppositional behaviors have been noted to occur in children with selective mutism, although oppositional behavior may be limited to situations requiring speech. Communication delays or disorders also may appear in some children with selective mutism\nRelationship To Other Classifications:.", "Disorder: Specific Phobia\nICD-9: 300. 29, ICD-10: Variable\nNotes: \nDiagnostic Criteria:\n  A: Marked fear or anxiety about a specific object or situation (e. g. , flying, heights, animals, receiving an injection, seeing blood). Note: In children, the fear or anxiety may be expressed by crying, tantrums, freezing, or clinging. B: The phobic object or situation almost always provokes immediate fear or anxiety. C: The phobic object or situation is actively avoided or endured with intense fear or anxiety\n  D: The fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual danger posed by the specific object or situation and to the sociocultural context. E: The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, typically lasting for 6 months or more\n  F: The fear, anxiety, or avoidance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning\n  G: The disturbance is not better explained by the symptoms of another mental disorder, including fear, anxiety, and avoidance of situations associated with panic-like symptoms or other incapacitating symptoms (as in agoraphobia): objects or situations related to obsessions (as in obsessive-compulsive disorder); reminders of traumatic events (as in posttraumatic stress disorder); separation from home or attachment figures (as in separation anxiety disorder); or social situations (as in social anxiety disorder). Disorder Id: 52\nDiagnostic Features: A key feature of this disorder is that the fear or anxiety is circumscribed to the presence of a particular situation or object (Criterion A), which may be termed the phobic stimulus. The categories of feared situations or objects are provided as specifiers. Many individuals fear objects or situations from more than one category, or phobic stimulus. For the diagnosis of specific phobia, the response must differ from normal, transient fears that commonly occur in the population. To meet the criteria for a diagnosis, the fear or anxiety must be intense or severe (i. e. , \"marked\") (Criterion A). The amount of fear experienced may vary with proximity to the feared object or situation and may occur in anticipation of or in the actual presence of the object or situation. Also, the fear or anxiety may take the form of a full or limited symptom panic attack (i. e. , expected panic attack). Another characteristic of specific phobias is that fear or anxiety is evoked nearly every time the individual comes into contact with the phobic stimulus (Criterion B). Thus, an individual who becomes anxious only occasionally upon being confronted with the situation or object (e. g. , becomes anxious when flying only on one out of every five airplane flights) would not be diagnosed with specific phobia. However, the degree of fear or anxiety expressed may vary (from anticipatory anxiety to a full panic attack) across different occasions of encountering the phobic object or situation because of various contextual factors such as the presence of others, duration of exposure, and other threatening elements such as turbulence on a flight for individuals who fear flying. Fear and anxiety are often expressed differently between children and adults. Also, the fear or anxiety occurs as soon as the phobic object or situation is encountered (i. e. , immediately rather than being delayed). The individual actively avoids the situation, or if he or she either is unable or decides not to avoid it, the situation or object evokes intense fear or anxiety (Criterion C). Active avoidance means the individual intentionally behaves in ways that are designed to prevent or minimize contact with phobic objects or situations (e. g. , takes tunnels instead of bridges on daily commute to work for fear of heights; avoids entering a dark room for fear of spiders; avoids accepting a job in a locale where a phobic stimulus is more common). Avoid- ance behaviors are often obvious (e. g. , an individual who fears blood refusing to go to the doctor) but are sometimes less obvious (e. g. , an individual who fears snakes refusing to look at pictures ihat resemble the form or shape of snakes). Many individuals with specific phobias have suffered over many years and have changed their living circumstances in ways designed to avoid the phobic object or situation as much as possible (e. g. , an individual diagnosed with specific phobia, animal, who moves to reside in an area devoid of the particular feared animal). Therefore, they no longer experience fear or anxiety in their daily life. In such instances, avoidance behaviors or ongoing refusal to engage in activities that would involve exposure to the phobic object or situation (e. g. , repeated refusal to accept offers for work-related travel because of fear of flying) may be helpful in confirming the diagnosis in the absence of overt anxiety or panic. The fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual danger that the object or situation poses, or more intense than is deemed necessary (Criterion D). Although individuals with specific phobia often recognize their reactions as disproportionate, they tend to overestimate the danger in their feared situations, and thus the judgment of being out of proportion is made by the clinician. The individual's sociocultural context should also be taken into account. For example, fears of the dark may be reasonable in a context of ongoing violence, and fear of insects may be more disproportionate in settings where insects are consumed in the diet. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, typically lasting for 6 months or more (Criterion E), which helps distinguish the disorder from transient fears that are common in the population, particularly among children. However, the duration criterion should be used as a general guide, with allowance for some degree of flexibility. The specific phobia must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning in order for the disorder to be diagnosed (Criterion F). Recording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis: Individuals with specific phobia typically experience an increase in physiological arousal in anticipation of or during exposure to a phobic object or situation. However, the physiological response to the feared situation or object varies. Whereas individuals with situational, natural environment, and animal specific phobias are likely to show sympathetic nervous system arousal, individuals with blood-injection-injury specific phobia often demonstrate a vasovagal fainting or near-fainting response that is marked by initial brief acceleration of heart rate and elevation of blood pressure followed by a deceleration of heart rate and a drop in blood pressure. Current neural systems models for specific phobia emphasize the amygdala and related structures, much as in other anxiety disorders. Prevalence: In the United States, the 12-month community prevalence estimate for specific phobia is approximately 7%-9%. Prevalence rates in European countries are largely similar to those in the United States (e. g. , about 6%), but rates are generally lower in Asian, African, and Latin American countries (2%-4%). Prevalence rates are approximately 5% in children and are approximately 16% in 13- to 17-year-olds. Prevalence rates are lower in older individuals (about 3%-5%), possibly reflecting diminishing severity to subclinical levels. Females are more frequently affected than males, at a rate of approximately 2:1, although rates vary across different phobic stimuli. That is, animal, natural environment, and situational specific phobias are predominantly experienced by females, whereas blood-injection-injury phobia is experienced nearly equally by both genders\nDevelopment And Course: Specific phobia sometimes develops following a traumatic event (e. g. , being attacked by an animal or stuck in an elevator), observation of others going through a traumatic event (e. g. , watching someone drown), an unexpected panic attack in the to be feared situation (e. g. , an unexpected panic attack while on the subway), or informational transmission (e. g. , extensive media coverage of a plane crash). However, many individuals with specific phobia are unable to recall the specific reason for the onset of their phobias. Specific phobia usually develops in early childhood, with the majority of cases developing prior to age 10 years. The median age at onset is between 7 and 11 years, with the mean at about 10 years. Situational specific phobias tend to have a later age at onset than natural environment, animal, or blood-injection-injury specific phobias. Specific phobias that develop in childhood and adolescence are likely to wax and wane during that period. However, phobias that do persist into adulthood are unlikely to remit for the majority of individuals. When specific phobia is being diagnosed in children, two issues should be considered. First, young children may express their fear and anxiety by crying, tantrums, freezing, or clinging. Second, young children typically are not able to understand the concept of avoidance. Therefore, the clinician should assemble additional information from parents, teachers, or others who know the child well. Excessive fears are quite common in young children but are usually transitory and only mildly impairing and thus considered developmentally appropriate. In such cases a diagnosis of specific phobia would not be made. When the diagnosis of specific phobia is being considered in a child, it is important to assess the degree of impairment and the duration of the fear, anxiety, or avoidance, and whether it is typical for the child's particular developmental stage. Although the prevalence of specific phobia is lower in older populations, it remains one of the more commonly experienced disorders in late life. Several issues should be considered when diagnosing specific phobia in older populations. First, older individuals may be more likely to endorse natural environment specific phobias, as well as phobias of falling. Second, specific phobia (like all anxiety disorders) tends to co-occur with medical concerns in older individuals, including coronary heart disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Third, older individuals may be more likely to attribute the symptoms of anxiety to medical conditions. Fourth, older individuals may be more likely to manifest anxiety in an atypical manner (e. g. , involving symptoms of both anxiety and depression) and thus be more likely to warrant a diagnosis of unspecified anxiety disorder. Additionally, the presence of specific phobia in older adults is associated with decreased quality of life and may serve as a risk factor for major neurocognitive disorder. Although most specific phobias develop in childhood and adolescence, it is possible for a specific phobia to develop at any age, often as the result of experiences that are traumatic. For example, phobias of choking almost always follow a near-choking event at any age. Risk And Prognostic Factors: Temperamental. Temperamental risk factors for specific phobia, such as negative affectivity (neuroticism) or behavioral inhibition, are risk factors for other anxiety disorders as well. Environmental. Environmental risk factors for specific phobias, such as parental overprotectiveness, parental loss and separation, and physical and sexual abuse, tend to predict other anxiety disorders as well. As noted earlier, negative or traumatic encounters with the feared object or situation sometimes (but not always) precede the development of specific phobia. Genetic and physiological. There may be a genetic susceptibility to a certain category of specific phobia (e. g. , an individual with a first-degree relative with a specific phobia of animals is significantly more likely to have the same specific phobia than any other category of phobia). Individuals with blood-injection-injury phobia show a unique propensity to vasovagal syncope (fainting) in the presence of the phobic stimulus. Culture Related Diagnostic Issues: In the United States, Asians and Latinos report significantly lower rates of specific phobia than non-Latino whites, African Americans, and Native Americans. In addition to having lower prevalence rates of specific phobia, some countries outside of the United States, particularly Asian and African countries, show differing phobia content, age at onset, and gender ratios\nGender Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nSuicide Risk: Individuals with specific phobia are up to 60% more likely to make a suicide attempt than are individuals without the diagnosis. However, it is likely that these elevated rates are primarily due to comorbidity with personality disorders and other anxiety disorders. Functional Consequences: Individuals with specific phobia show similar patterns of impairment in psychosocial functioning and decreased quality of life as individuals with other anxiety disorders and alcohol and substance use disorders, including impairments in occupational and interpersonal functioning. In older adults, impairment may be seen in caregiving duties and volunteer activities. Also, fear of falling in older adults can lead to reduced mobility and reduced physical and social functioning, and may lead to receiving formal or informal home support. The distress and impairment caused by specific phobias tend to increase with the number of feared objects and situations. Thus, an individual who fears four objects or situations is likely to have more impairment in his or her occupational and social roles and a lower quality of life than an individual who fears only one object or situation. Individuals with blood-injection-injury specific phobia are often reluctant to obtain medical care even when a medical concern is present. Additionally, fear of vomiting and choking may substantially reduce dietary intake\nDiagnostic Markers:  \nDifferential Diagnosis: Agoraphobia. Situational specific phobia may resemble agoraphobia in its clinical presentation, given the overlap in feared situations (e. g. , flying, enclosed places, elevators). If an individual fears only one of the agoraphobia situations, then specific phobia, situational, may be diagnosed. If two or more agoraphobic situations are feared, a diagnosis of agoraphobia is likely warranted. For example, an individual who fears airplanes and elevators (which overlap with the '\"public transportation\" agoraphobic situation) but does not fear other agoraphobic situations would be diagnosed with specific phobia, situational, whereas an individual who fears airplanes, elevators, and crowds (which overlap with two agoraphobic situations, \"using public transportation\" and \"standing in line and or being in a crowd\") would be diagnosed with agoraphobia. Criterion B of agoraphobia (the situations are feared or avoided \"because of thoughts that escape might be difficult or help might not be available in the event of developing panic-like symptoms or other incapacitating or embarrassing symptoms\") can also be useful in differentiating agoraphobia from specific phobia. If the situations are feared for other reasons, such as fear of being harmed directly by the object or situations (e. g. , fear of the plane crashing, fear of the animal biting), a specific phobia diagnosis may be more appropriate. Social anxiety disorder. If the situations are feared because of negative evaluation, social anxiety disorder should be diagnosed instead of specific phobia. Separation anxiety disorder. If the situations are feared because of separation from a primary caregiver or attachment figure, separation anxiety disorder should be diagnosed instead of specific phobia. Panic disorder. Individuals with specific phobia may experience panic attacks when confronted with their feared situation or object. A diagnosis of specific phobia would be given if the panic attacks only occurred in response to the specific object or situation, whereas a diagnosis of panic disorder would be given if the individual also experienced panic attacks that were unexpected (i. e. , not in response to the specific phobia object or situation). Obsessive-compulsive disorder. If an individual's primary fear or anxiety is of an object or situation as a result of obsessions (e. g. , fear of blood due to obsessive thoughts about contamination from blood-borne pathogens [i. e. , HIV]; fear of driving due to obsessive images of harming others), and if other diagnostic criteria for obsessive-compulsive disorder are met, then obsessive-compulsive disorder should be diagnosed. Trauma- and stressor-related disorders. If the phobia develops following a traumatic event, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) should be considered as a diagnosis. However, traumatic events can precede the onset of PTSD and specific phobia. In this case, a diagnosis of specific phobia would be assigned only if all of the criteria for PTSD are not met. Eating disorders. A diagnosis of specific phobia is not given if the avoidance behavior is exclusively limited to avoidance of food and food-related cues, in which case a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa should be considered. Schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders. When the fear and avoidance are due to delusional thinking (as in schizophrenia or other schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders), a diagnosis of specific phobia is not warranted. Comorbidity: Specific phobia is rarely seen in medical-clinical settings in the absence of other psychopathology and is more frequently seen in nonmedical mental health settings. Specific phobia is frequently associated with a range of other disorders, especially depression in older adults. Because of early onset, specific phobia is typically the temporally primary disorder. Individuals with specific phobia are at increased risk for the development of other disorders, including other anxiety disorders, depressive and bipolar disorders, substancerelated disorders, somatic symptom and related disorders, and personality disorders (particularly dependent personality disorder).

Examples include social interactions (e. g. , having a conversation, meeting unfamiliar people), being observed (e. g. , eating or drinking), and performing in front of others (e. g. , giving a speech). Note: In children, the anxiety must occur in peer settings and not just during interactions with adults\n  B: The individual fears that he or she will act in a way or show anxiety symptoms that will be negatively evaluated (i. e. , will be humiliating or embarrassing: will lead to rejection or offend others).

Disorder Id: 53\nDiagnostic Features: The essential feature of social anxiety disorder is a marked, or intense, fear or anxiety of social situations in which the individual may be scrutinized by others. In children the fear or anxiety must occur in peer settings and not just during interactions with adults (Criterion A). When exposed to such social situations, the individual fears that he or she will be negatively evaluated. The individual is concerned that he or she will be judged as anxious, weak, crazy, stupid, boring, intimidating, dirty, or unlikable. The individual fears that he or she will act or appear in a certain way or show anxiety symptoms, such as blushing, trembling, sweating, stumbling over one's words, or staring, that will be negatively evaluated by others (Criterion B). Some individuals fear offending others or being rejected as a result. Fear of offending others\u2014for example, by a gaze or by showing anxiety symptoms\u2014may be the predominant fear in individuals from cultures with strong collectivistic orientations. An individual with fear of trembling of the hands may avoid drinking, eating, writing, or pointing in public; an individual with fear of sweating may avoid shaking hands or eating spicy foods; and an individual with fear of blushing may avoid public performance, bright lights, or discussion about intimate topics. Some individuals fear and avoid urinating in public restrooms when other individuals are present (i. e. , paruresis, or \"shy bladder syndrome\"). The social situations almost always provoke fear or anxiety (Criterion C). Thus, an individual who becomes anxious only occasionally in the social situation(s) would not be diagnosed with social anxiety disorder. However, the degree and type of fear and anxiety may vary (e. g. , anticipatory anxiety, a panic attack) across different occasions. The anticipatory anxiety may occur sometimes far in advance of upcoming situations (e. g. , worrying every day for weeks before attending a social event, repeating a speech for days in advance). In children, the fear or anxiety may be expressed by crying, tantrums, freezing, clinging, or shrinking in social situations. The individual will often avoid the feared social situations. Alternatively, the situations are endured with intense fear or anxiety (Criterion D). Avoid- ance can be extensive (e. g. , not going to parties, refusing school) or subtle (e. g. , overpreparing the text of a speech, diverting attention to others, limiting eye contact). The fear or anxiety is judged to be out of proportion to the actual risk of being negatively evaluated or to the consequences of such negative evaluation (Criterion E). Sometimes, the anxiety may not be judged to be excessive, because it is related to an actual danger (e. g. , being bullied or tormented by others). However, individuals with social anxiety disorder often overestimate the negative consequences of social situations, and thus the judgment of being out of proportion is made by the clinician. The individual's sociocultural context needs to be taken into account when this judgment is being made. For example, in certain cultures, behavior that might otherwise appear socially anxious may be considered appropriate in social situations (e. g. , might be seen as a sign of respect). The duration of the disturbance is typically at least 6 months (Criterion F). This duration threshold helps distinguish the disorder from transient social fears that are common, particularly among children and in the community. However, the duration criterion should be used as a general guide, with allowance for some degree of flexibility. The fear, anxiety, and avoidance must interfere significantly with the individual's normal routine, occupational or academic functioning, or social activities or relationships, or must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning (Criterion G). For example, an individual who is afraid to speak in public would not receive a diagnosis of social anxiety disorder if this activity is not routinely encountered on the job or in classroom work, and if the individual is not significantly distressed about it. However, if the individual avoids, or is passed over for, the job or education he or she really wants because of social anxiety symptoms. Criterion G is met\nRecording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis: Individuals with social anxiety disorder may be inadequately assertive or excessively submissive or, less commonly, highly controlling of the conversation. They may show overly rigid body posture or inadequate eye contact, or speak with an overly soft voice. These individuals may be shy or withdrawn, and they may be less open in conversations and disclose little about themselves. They may seek employment in jobs that do not require social contact, although this is not the case for individuals with social anxiety disorder, performance only. They may live at home longer. Men may be delayed in marrying and having a family, whereas women who would want to work outside the home may live a life as homemaker and mother. Self-medication with substances is common (e. g. , drinking before going to a party). Social anxiety among older adults may also include exacerbation of symptoms of medical illnesses, such as increased tremor or tachycardia. Blushing is a hallmark physical response of social anxiety disorder. Prevalence: The 12-month prevalence estimate of social anxiety disorder for the United States is approximately 7%. Lower 12-month prevalence estimates are seen in much of the world using the same diagnostic instrument, clustering around 0. 5%-2. 0%; median prevalence in Europe is 2. 3%. The 12-month prevalence rates in children and adolescents are comparable to those in adults. Prevalence rates decrease with age. The 12-month prevalence for older adults ranges from 2% to 5%. In general, higher rates of social anxiety disorder are found in females than in males in the general population (with odds ratios ranging from 1. 5 to 2. 2), and the gender difference in prevalence is more pronounced in adolescents and young adults. Gender rates are equivalent or slightly higher for males in clinical samples, and it is assumed that gender roles and social expectations play a significant role in explaining the heightened help-seeking behavior in male patients. Prevalence in the United States is higher in American Indians and lower in persons of Asian, Latino, African American, and Afro-Caribbean descent compared with non-Hispanic whites\nDevelopment And Course: Median age at onset of social anxiety disorder in the United States is 13 years, and 75% of individuals have an age at onset between 8 and 15 years. The disorder sometimes emerges out of a childhood history of social inhibition or shyness in U. S. and European studies. Onset can also occur in early childhood. Onset of social anxiety disorder may follow a stressful or humiliating experience (e. g. , being bullied, vomiting during a public speech), or it may be insidious, developing slowly. First onset in adulthood is relatively rare and is more likely to occur after a stressful or humiliating event or after life changes that require new social roles (e. g. , marrying someone from a different social class, receiving a job promotion). Social anxiety disorder may diminish after an individual with fear of dating marries and may reemerge after divorce. Among individuals presenting to clinical care, the disorder tends to be particularly persistent. Adolescents endorse a broader pattern of fear and avoidance, including of dating, compared with younger children. Older adults express social anxiety at lower levels but across a broader range of situations, whereas younger adults express higher levels of social anxiety for specific situations. In older adults, social anxiety may concern disability due to declining sensory functioning (hearing, vision) or embarrassment about one's appearance (e. g. , tremor as a symptom of Parkinson's disease) or functioning due to medical conditions, incontinence, or cognitive impairment (e. g. , forgetting people's names). In the community approximately 30% of individuals with social anxiety disorder experience remission of symptoms within 1 year, and about 50% experience remission within a few years. For approximately 60% of individuals without a specific treatment for social anxiety disorder, the course takes several years or longer. Detection of social anxiety disorder in older adults may be challenging because of several factors, including a focus on somatic symptoms, comorbid medical illness, limited insight, changes to social environment or roles that may obscure impairment in social functioning, or reticence about describing psychological distress. Risk And Prognostic Factors: Temperamental. Underlying traits that predispose individuals to social anxiety disorder include behavioral inhibition and fear of negative evaluation. Environmental. There is no causative role of increased rates of childhood maltreatment or other early-onset psychosocial adversity in the development of social anxiety disorder. However, childhood maltreatment and adversity are risk factors for social anxiety disorder. Genetic and physiological. Traits predisposing individuals to social anxiety disorder, such as behavioral inhibition, are strongly genetically influenced. The genetic influence is subject to gene-environment interaction; that is, children with high behavioral inhibition are more susceptible to environmental influences, such as socially anxious modeling by parents. Also, social anxiety disorder is heritable (but performance-only anxiety less so). First-degree relatives have a two to six times greater chance of having social anxiety disorder, and liability to the disorder involves the interplay of disorder-specific (e. g. , fear of negative evaluation) and nonspecific (e. g. , neuroticism) genetic factors. Culture Related Diagnostic Issues: The syndrome of taijin kyofusho (e. g. , in Japan and Korea) is often characterized by socialevaluative concerns, fulfilling criteria for social anxiety disorder, that are associated with the fear that the individual makes other people uncomfortable (e. g. , \"My gaze upsets people so they look away and avoid me\"), a fear that is at times experienced with delusional intensity. This symptom may also be found in non-Asian settings. Other presentations of taijin kyofusho may fulfill criteria for body dysmorphic disorder or delusional disorder. Immigrant status is associated with significantly lower rates of social anxiety disorder in both Latino and non-Latino white groups. Prevalence rates of social anxiety disorder may not be in line with self-reported social anxiety levels in the same culture\u2014that is, societies with strong collectivistic orientations may report high levels of social anxiety but low prevalence of social anxiety disorder\nGender Related Diagnostic Issues: Females with social anxiety disorder report a greater number of social fears and comorbid depressive, bipolar, and anxiety disorders, whereas males are more likely to fear dating, have oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder, and use alcohol and illicit drugs to relieve symptoms of the disorder. Paruresis is more common in males\nSuicide Risk:  \nFunctional Consequences: Social anxiety disorder is associated with elevated rates of school dropout and with decreased well-being, employment, workplace productivity, socioeconomic status, and quality of life. Social anxiety disorder is also associated with being single, unmarried, or divorced and with not having children, particularly among men. In older adults, there may be impairment in caregiving duties and volunteer activities. Social anxiety disorder also impedes leisure activities. Despite the extent of distress and social impairment associated with social anxiety disorder, only about half of individuals with the disorder in Western societies ever seek treatment, and they tend to do so only after 15-20 years of experiencing symptoms. Not being employed is a strong predictor for ihe persistence of social aimety disorder\nDiagnostic Markers:  \nDifferential Diagnosis: Normative shyness. Shyness (i. e. , social reticence) is a common personality trait and is not by itself pathological. In some societies, shyness is even evaluated positively. However, when there is a significant adverse impact on social, occupational, and other important areas of functioning, a diagnosis of social anxiety disorder should be considered, and when full diagnostic criteria for social anxiety disorder are met, the disorder should be diagnosed. Only a minority (12%) of self-identified shy individuals in the United States have symptoms that meet diagnostic criteria for social anxiety disorder. Agoraphobia. Individuals with agoraphobia may fear and avoid social situations (e. g. , going to a movie) because escape might be difficult or help might not be available in the event of incapacitation or panic-like symptoms, whereas individuals with social anxiety disorder are most fearful of scrutiny by others. Moreover, individuals with social anxiety disorder are likely to be calm when left entirely alone, which is often not the case in agoraphobia. Panic disorder. Individuals with social anxiety disorder may have panic attacks, but the concern is about fear of negative evaluation, whereas in panic disorder the concern is about the panic attacks themselves. Generalized anxiety disorder. Social worries are common in generalized anxiety disorder, but the focus is more on the nature of ongoing relationships rather than on fear of negative evaluation. Individuals with generalized anxiety disorder, particularly children, may have excessive worries about the quality of their social performance, but these worries also pertain to nonsocial performance and when the individual is not being evaluated by others. In social anxiety disorder, the worries focus on social performance and others' evaluation. Separation anxiety disorder. Individuals with separation anxiety disorder may avoid social settings (including school refusal) because of concerns about being separated from attachment figures or, in children, about requiring the presence of a parent when it is not developmentally appropriate. Individuals with separation anxiety disorder are usually comfortable in social settings when their attachment figure is present or when they are at home, whereas those with social anxiety disorder may be uncomfortable when social situations occur at home or in the presence of attachment figures. Specific phobias. Individuals with specific phobias may fear embarrassment or humiliation (e. g. , embarrassment about fainting when they have their blood drawn), but they do not generally fear negative evaluation in other social situations. Selective mutism. Individuals with selective mutism may fail to speak because of fear of negative evaluation, but they do not fear negative evaluation in social situations where no speaking is required (e. g. , nonverbal play). Major depressive disorder. Individuals with major depressive disorder may be concerned about being negatively evaluated by others because they feel they are bad or not worthy of being liked. In contrast, individuals with social anxiety disorder are worried about being negatively evaluated because of certain social behaviors or physical symptoms. Body dysmorphic disorder. Individuals with body dysmorphic disorder are preoccupied with one or more perceived defects or flaws in their physical appearance that are not observable or appear slight to others; this preoccupation often causes social anxiety and avoidance. If their social fears and avoidance are caused only by their beliefs about their appearance, a separate diagnosis of social anxiety disorder is not warranted. Delusional disorder. Individuals with delusional disorder may have nonbizarre delusions and/or hallucinations related to the delusional theme that focus on being rejected by or offending others. Although extent of insight into beliefs about social situations may vary, many individuals with social anxiety disorder have good insight that their beliefs are out of proportion to the actual threat posed by the social situation. Autism spectrum disorder. Social anxiety and social communication deficits are hallmarks of autism spectrum disorder. Individuals with social anxiety disorder typically have adequate age-appropriate social relationships and social communication capacity, although they may appear to have impairment in these areas when first interacting with unfamiliar peers or adults. Personality disorders. Given its frequent onset in childhood and its persistence into and through adulthood, social anxiety disorder may resemble a personality disorder. The most apparent overlap is with avoidant personality disorder. Individuals with avoidant personality disorder have a broader avoidance pattern than those with social anxiety disorder. Nonetheless, social anxiety disorder is typically more comorbid with avoidant personality disorder than with other personality disorders, and avoidant personality disorder is more comorbid with social anxiety disorder than with other anxiety disorders. Other mental disorders. Social fears and discomfort can occur as part of schizophrenia, but other evidence for psychotic symptoms is usually present. In individuals with an eating disorder, it is important to determine that fear of negative evaluation about eating disorder symptoms or behaviors (e. g. , purging and vomiting) is not the sole source of social anxiety before applying a diagnosis of social anxiety disorder. Similarly, obsessivecompulsive disorder may be associated with social anxiety, but the additional diagnosis of social anxiety disorder is used only when social fears and avoidance are independent of the foci of the obsessions and compulsions. Other medical conditions. Medical conditions may produce symptoms that may be embarrassing (e. g. trembling in Parkinson's disease). When the fear of negative evaluation due to other medical conditions is excessive, a diagnosis of social anxiety disorder should be considered. Oppositional defiant disorder. Refusal to speak due to opposition to authority figures should be differentiated from failure to speak due to fear of negative evaluation. Comorbidity: Social anxiety disorder is often comorbid with other anxiety disorders, major depressive disorder, and substance use disorders, and the onset of social anxiety disorder generally precedes that of the other disorders, except for specific phobia and separation anxiety disorder. Chronic social isolation in the course of a social anxiety disorder may result in major depressive disorder. Comorbidity with depression is high also in older adults. Substances may be used as self-medication for social fears, but the symptoms of substance intoxication or withdrawal, such as trembling, may also be a source of (further) social fear. Social anxiety disorder is frequently comorbid with bipolar disorder or body dysmorphic disorder; for example, an individual has body dysmorphic disorder concerning a preoccupation with a slight irregularity of her nose, as well as social anxiety disorder because of a severe fear of sounding unintelligent. The more generalized form of social anxiety disorder, but not social anxiety disorder, performance only, is often comorbid with avoidant personality disorder. In children, comorbidities with high-functioning autism and selective mutism are common.

Disorder Id: 54\nDiagnostic Features: Panic disorder refers to recurrent unexpected panic attacks (Criterion A). A panic attack is an abrupt surge of intense fear or intense discomfort that reaches a peak within minutes, and during which time four or more of a list of 13 physical and cognitive symptoms occur. The term recurrent literally means more than one unexpected panic attack. The term unexpected refers to a panic attack for which there is no obvious cue or trigger at the time of occurrence\u2014that is, the attack appears to occur from out of the blue, such as when the individual is relaxing or emerging from sleep (nocturnal panic attack). In contrast, expected panic attacks are attacks for which there is an obvious cue or trigger, such as a situation in which panic attacks typically occur. The determination of whether panic attacks are expected or unexpected is made by the clinician, who makes this judgment based on a combination of careful questioning as to the sequence of events preceding or leading up to the attack and the individual's own judgment of whether or not the attack seemed to occur for no apparent reason. Cultural interpretations may influence the assignment of panic attacks as expected or unexpected (see section \"Culture-Related Diagnostic Issues\" for this disorder). In the United States and Europe, approximately one-half of individuals with panic disorder have expected panic attacks as well as unexpected panic attacks. Thus, the presence of expected panic attacks does not rule out the diagnosis of panic disorder. For more details regarding expected versus unexpected panic attacks, see the text accompanying panic attacks (pp. 214-217). The frequency and severity of panic attacks vary widely. In terms of frequency, there may be moderately frequent attacks (e. g. , one per week) for months at a time, or short bursts of more frequent attacks (e. g. , daily) separated by weeks or months without any attacks or with less frequent attacks (e. g. , two per month) over many years. Persons who have infrequent panic attacks resemble persons with more frequent panic attacks in terms of panic attack symptoms, demographic characteristics, comorbidity with other disorders, family history, and biological data. In terms of severity, individuals with panic disorder may have both full-symptom (four or more symptoms) and limited-symptom (fewer than four symptoms) attacks, and the number and type of panic attack symptoms frequently differ from one panic attack to the next. However, more than one unexpected full-symptom panic attack is required for the diagnosis of panic disorder. The worries about panic attacks or their consequences usually pertain to physical concerns, such as worry that panic attacks reflect the presence of life-threatening illnesses (e. g. , cardiac disease, seizure disorder); social concerns, such as embarrassment or fear of being judged negatively by others because of visible panic symptoms; and concerns about mental functioning, such as ''going crazy\" or losing control (Criterion B). The maladaptive changes in behavior represent attempts to minimize or avoid panic attacks or their consequences. Examples include avoiding physical exertion, reorganizing daily life to ensure that help is available in the event of a panic attack, restricting usual daily activities, and avoiding agoraphobia-type situations, such as leaving home, using public transportation, or shopping. If agoraphobia is present, a separate diagnosis of agoraphobia is given. Recording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis: One type of unexpected panic attack is a nocturnal panic attack (i. e. , waking from sleep in a state of panic, which differs from panicking after fully waking from sleep). In the United States, this type of panic attack has been estimated to occur at least one time in roughly one-quarter to one-third of individuals with panic disorder, of whom the majority also have daytime panic attacks. In addition to worry about panic attacks and their consequences, many individuals with panic disorder report constant or intermittent feelings of anxiety that are more broadly related to health and mental health concerns. For example, individuals with panic disorder often anticipate a catastrophic outcome from a mild physical symptom or medication side effect (e. g. , thinking that they may have heart disease or that a headache means presence of a brain tumor). Such individuals often are relatively intolerant of medication side effects. In addition, there may be pervasive concerns about abilities to complete daily tasks or withstand daily stressors, excessive use of drugs (e. g. , alcohol, prescribed medications or illicit drugs) to control panic attacks, or extreme behaviors aimed at controlling panic attacks (e. g. , severe restrictions on food intake or avoidance of specific foods or medications because of concerns about physical symptoms that provoke panic attacks). Prevalence: In the general population, the 12-month prevalence estimate for panic disorder across the United States and several European countries is about 2%-3% in adults and adolescents. In the United States, significantly lower rates of panic disorder are reported among Latinos, African Americans, Caribbean blacks, and Asian Americans, compared with non-Latino whites; American Indians, by contrast, have significantly higher rates. Lower estimates have been reported for Asian, African, and Latin American countries, ranging from 0. 1% to 0. 8%. Females are more frequently affected than males, at a rate of approximately 2:1. The gender differentiation occurs in adolescence and is already observable before age 14 years. Although panic attacks occur in children, the overall prevalence of panic disorder is low before age 14 years (<0. 4%). The rates of panic disorder show a gradual increase during adolescence, particularly in females, and possibly following the onset of puberty, and peak during adulthood. The prevalence rates decline in older individuals (i. e. , 0. 7% in adults over the age of 64), possibly reflecting diminishing severity to subclinical levels. Development And Course: The median age at onset for panic disorder in the United States is 20-24 years. A small number of cases begin in childhood, and onset after age 45 years is unusual but can occur. The usual course, if the disorder is untreated, is chronic but waxing and waning. Some individuals may have episodic outbreaks with years of remission in between, and others may have continuous severe symptomatology. Only a minority of individuals have full remission without subsequent relapse within a few years. The course of panic disorder typically is complicated by a range of other disorders, in particular other anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, and substance use disorders (see section \"Comorbidity\" for this disorder). Although panic disorder is very rare in childhood, first occurrence of \"fearful spells\" is often dated retrospectively back to childhood. As in adults, panic disorder in adolescents tends to have a chronic course and is frequently comorbid with other anxiety, depressive, and bipolar disorders. To date, no differences in the clinical presentation between adolescents and adults have been found. However, adolescents may be less worried about additional panic attacks than are young adults. Lower prevalence of panic disorder in older adults appears to be attributable to age-related \"dampening\" of the autonomic nervous system response. Many older individuals with \"panicky feelings\" are observed to have a \"hybrid\" of limited-symptom panic attacks and generalized anxiety. Also, older adults tend to attribute their panic attacks to certain stressful situations, such as a medical procedure or social setting. Older individuals may retrospectively endorse explanations for the panic attack^which would preclude the diagnosis of panic disorder), even if an attack might actually have been unexpected in the moment (and thus qualify as the basis for a panic disorder diagnosis). This may result in under-endorsement of unexpected panic attacks in older individuals. Thus, careful questioning of older adults is required to assess whether panic attacks were expected before entering the situation, so that unexpected panic attacks and the diagnosis of panic disorder are not overlooked. While the low rate of panic disorder in children could relate to difficulties in symptom reporting, this seems unlikely given that children are capable of reporting intense fear or panic in relation to separation and to phobic objects or phobic situations. Adolescents might be less willing than adults to openly discuss panic attacks. Therefore, clinicians should be aware that unexpected panic attacks do occur in adolescents, much as they do in adults, and be attuned to this possibility when encountering adolescents presenting with episodes of intense fear or distress. Risk And Prognostic Factors: Temperamental. Negative affectivity (neuroticism) (i. e. , proneness to experiencing negative emotions) and anxiety sensitivity (i. e. , the disposition to believe that symptoms of anxiety are harmful) are risk factors for the onset of panic attacks and, separately, for worry about panic, although their risk status for the diagnosis of panic disorder is unknown. History of \"fearful spells\" (i. e. , limited-symptom attacks that do not meet full criteria for a panic attack) may be a risk factor for later panic attacks and panic disorder. Although separation anxiety in childhood, especially when severe, may precede the later development of panic disorder, it is not a consistent risk factor. Environmental. Reports of childhood experiences of sexual and physical abuse are more common in panic disorder than in certain other anxiety disorders. Smoking is a risk factor for panic attacks and panic disorder. Most individuals report identifiable stressors in the months before their first panic attack (e. g. , interpersonal stressors and stressors related to physical well-being, such as negative experiences with illicit or prescription drugs, disease, or death in the family). Genetic and physiological. It is believed that multiple genes confer vulnerability to panic disorder. However, the exact genes, gene products, or functions related to the genetic regions implicated remain unknown. Current neural systems models for panic disorder emphasize the amygdala and related structures, much as in other anxiety disorders. There is an increased risk for panic disorder among offspring of parents with anxiety, depressive, and bipolar disorders. Respiratory disturbance, such as asthma, is associated with panic disorder, in terms of past history, comorbidity, and family history. Culture Related Diagnostic Issues: The rate of fears about mental and somatic symptoms of anxiety appears to vary across cultures and may influence the rate of panic attacks and panic disorder. Also, cultural expectations may influence the classification of panic attacks as expected or unexpected. For example, a Vietnamese individual who has a panic attack after walking out into a windy environment (trilng gio; \"hit by the wind\") may attribute the panic attack to exposure to wind as a result of the cultural syndrome that links these two experiences, resulting in classification of the panic attack as expected. Various other cultural syndromes are associated with panic disorder, including ataque de nervios (\"attack of nerves\") among Latin Americans and khyal attacks and \"soul loss\" among Cambodians. Ataque de nervios may involve trembling, uncontrollable screaming or crying, aggressive or suicidal behavior, and depersonalization or derealization, which may be experienced longer than the few minutes typical of panic attacks. Some clinical presentations of ataque de nervios fulfill criteria for conditions other than panic attack (e. g. , other specified dissociative disorder). These syndromes impact the symptoms and frequency of panic disorder, including the individual's attribution of unexpectedness, as cultural syndromes may create fear of certain situations, ranging from interpersonal arguments (associated with ataque de nervios), to types of exertion (associated with khy\u00e2l attacks), to atmospheric wind (associated with tr\u00f9ng gio attacks). Clarification of the details of cultural attributions may aid in distinguishing expected and unexpected panic attacks. For more information regarding cultural syndromes, refer to the \"Glossary of Cultural Concepts of Distress\" in the Appendix. The specific worries about panic attacks or their consequences are likely to vary from one culture to another (and across different age groups and gender). For panic disorder, U. S. community samples of non-Latino whites have significantly less functional impairment than African Americans. There are also higher rates of objectively defined severity in non-Latino Caribbean blacks with panic disorder, and lower rates of panic disorder overall in both African American and Afro-Caribbean groups, suggesting that among individuals of African descent, the criteria for panic disorder may be met only when there is substantial severity and impairment. Gender Related Diagnostic Issues: The clinical features of panic disorder do not appear to differ between males and females. There is some evidence for sexual dimorphism, with an association between panic disorder and the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene in females only. Suicide Risk: Panic attacks and a diagnosis of panic disorder in the past 12 months are related to a higher rate of suicide attempts and suicidal ideation in the past 12 months even when comorbidity and a history of childhood abuse and other suicide risk factors are taken into account. Functional Consequences: Panic disorder is associated with high levels of social, occupational, and physical disability; considerable economic costs; and the highest number of medical visits among the anxiety disorders, although the effects are strongest with the presence of agoraphobia. Individuals with panic disorder may be frequently absent from work or school for doctor and emergency room visits, which can lead to unemployment or dropping out of school. In older adults, impairment may be seen in caregiving duties or volunteer activities. Fullsymptom panic attacks typically are associated with greater morbidity (e. g. , greater health care utilization, more disability, poorer quality of life) than limited-symptom attacks. Diagnostic Markers: Agents with disparate mechanisms of action, such as sodium lactate, caffeine, isoproterenol, yohimbine, carbon dioxide, and cholecystokinin, provoke panic attacks in individuals with panic disorder to a much greater extent than in healthy control subjects (and in some cases, than in individuals with other anxiety, depressive, or bipolar disorders without panic attacks). Also, for a proportion of individuals with panic disorder, panic attacks are related to hypersensitive medullary carbon dioxide detectors, resulting in hypocapnia and other respiratory irregularities. However, none of these laboratory findings are considered diagnostic of panic disorder. Differential Diagnosis: other specified anxiety disorder or unspecified anxiety disorder. Panic disorder should not be diagnosed if full-symptom (unexpected) panic attacks have never been experienced. In the case of only limited-symptom unexpected panic attacks, an other specified anxiety disorder or unspecified anxiety disorder diagnosis should be considered. Anxiety disorder due to another medical condition. Panic disorder is not diagnosed if the panic attacks are judged to be a direct physiological consequence of another medical condition. Examples of medical conditions that can cause panic attacks include hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, pheochromocytoma, vestibular dysfunctions, seizure disorders, and cardiopulmonary conditions (e. g. , arrhythmias, supraventricular tachycardia, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD]). Appropriate laboratory tests (e. g. , serum calcium levels for hyperparathyroidism; Holter monitor for arrhythmias) or physical examinations (e. g. , for cardiac conditions) may be helpful in determining the etiological role of another medical condition. Substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder. Panic disorder is not diagnosed if the panic attacks are judged to be a direct physiological consequence of a substance. Intoxication with central nervous system stimulants (e. g. , cocaine, amphetamines, caffeine) or cannabis and withdrawal from central nervous system depressants (e. g. , alcohol, barbiturates) can precipitate a panic attack. However, if panic attacks continue to occur outside of the context of substance use (e. g. , long after the effects of intoxication or withdrawal have ended), a diagnosis of panic disorder should be considered. In addition, because panic disorder may precede substance use in some individuals and may be associated with increased substance use, especially for purposes of self-medication, a detailed history should be taken to determine if the individual had panic attacks prior to excessive substance use. If this is the case, a diagnosis of panic disorder should be considered in addition to a diagnosis of substance use disorder. Features such as onset after age 45 years or the presence of atypical symptoms during a panic attack (e. g. , vertigo, loss of consciousness, loss of bladder or bowel control, slurred speech, armiesia) suggest the possibility that another medical condition or a substance may be causing the panic attack symptoms. Other mental disorders with panic attacks as an associated feature (e. g. , other anxiety disorders and psychotic disorders). Panic attacks that occur as a symptom of other anxiety disorders are expected (e. g. , triggered by social situations in social anxiety disorder, by phobic objects or situations in specific phobia or agoraphobia, by worry in generalized anxiety disorder, by separation from home or attachment figures in separation anxiety disorder) and thus would not meet criteria for panic disorder. (Note: Sometimes an unexpected panic attack is associated with the onset of another anxiety disorder, but then the attacks become expected, whereas panic disorder is characterized by recurrent unexpected panic attacks. ) If the panic attacks occur only in response to specific triggers, then only the relevant anxiety disorder is assigned. However, if the individual experiences unexpected panic attacks as well and shows persistent concern and worry or behavioral change because of the attacks, then an additional diagnosis of panic disorder should be considered\nComorbidity: Panic disorder infrequently occurs in clinical settings in the absence of other psychopathology. The prevalence of panic disorder is elevated in individuals with other disorders, particularly other anxiety disorders (and especially agoraphobia), major depression, bipolar disorder, and possibly mild alcohol use disorder. While panic disorder often has an earlier age at onset than the comorbid disorder(s), onset sometimes occurs after the comorbid disorder and may be seen as a severity marker of the comorbid illness. Reported lifetime rates of comorbidity between major depressive disorder and panic disorder vary widely, ranging from 10% to 65% in individuals with panic disorder. In approximately one-third of individuals with both disorders, the depression precedes the onset of panic disorder. In the remaining two-thirds, depression occurs coincident with or following the onset of panic disorder. A subset of individuals with panic disorder develop a substance-related disorder, which for some represents an attempt to treat their anxiety with alcohol or medications. Comorbidity with other anxiety disorders and illness anxiety disorder is also common. Panic disorder is significantly comorbid with numerous general medical symptoms and conditions, including, but not limited to, dizziness, cardiac arrhythmias, hyperthyroidism, asthma, COPD, and irritable bowel syndrome. However, the nature of the association (e. g. , cause and effect) between panic disorder and these conditions remains unclear. Although mitral valve prolapse and thyroid disease are more common among individuals with panic disorder than in the general population, the differences in prevalence are not consistent. Relationship To Other Classifications:.", "Disorder: Panic Attack (Specifier)\nICD-9: n/a, ICD-10: n/a\nNotes: Symptoms are provided for the purpose of identifying a panic attack; however, panic attack is not a mental disorder and cannot be coded. Panic attacl<s can occur in the context of any anxiety disorder as well as other mental disorders (e. g. , depressive disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, substance use disorders) and some medical conditions (e. g. , cardiac, respiratory, vestibular, gastrointestinal). When the presence of a panic attack is identified, it should be noted as a specifier (e. g. , \u201cposttraumatic stress disorder with panic attacks\u201d). For panic disorder, the presence of panic attack is contained within the criteria for the disorder and panic attack is not used as a specifier\nDiagnostic Criteria:\n  1: Palpitations, pounding heart, or accelerated heart rate. 2: Sweating\n  3: Trembling or shaking\n  4: Sensations of shortness of breath or smothering\n  5: Feelings of choking\n  6: Chest pain or discomfort\n  7: Nausea or abdominal distress\n  8: Feeling dizzy, unsteady, light-headed or faint\n  9: Chills or heat sensations\n  10: Paresthesias (numbness or tingling sensations)\n  11: Derealization (feelings of unreality) or depersonalization (being detached from oneself)\n  12: Fear of losing control or 'going crazy'\n  13: Fear of dying\nDisorder Id: 55\nDiagnostic Features: The essential feature of a panic attack is an abrupt surge of intense fear or intense discomfort that reaches a peak within minutes and during which time four or more of 13 physical and cognitive symptoms occur. Eleven of these 13 symptoms are physical (e. g. , palpitations, sweating), while two are cognitive (i. e. , fear of losing control or going crazy, fear of dying). 'Tear of going crazy\" is a colloquialism often used by individuals with panic attacks and is not intended as a pejorative or diagnostic term. The term within minutes means that the time to peak intensity is literally only a few minutes. A panic attack can arise from either a calm state or an anxious state, and time to peak intensity should be assessed independently of any preceding anxiety. That is, the start of the panic attack is the point at which there is an abrupt increase in discomfort rather than the point at which armety first developed. Likewise, a panic attack can return to either an anxious state or a calm state and possibly peak again. A panic attack is distinguished from ongoing anxiety by its time to peak intensity, which occurs within minutes; its discrete nature; and its typically greater severity. Attacks that meet all other criteria but have fewer than four physical and/or cognitive symptoms are referred to as limited-symptom attacks. There are two characteristic types of panic attacks: expected and unexpected. Expected panic attacks are attacks for which there is an obvious cue or trigger, such as situations in which panic attacks have typically occurred. Unexpected panic attacks are those for which there is no obvious cue or trigger at the time of occurrence (e. g. , when relaxing or out of sleep [nocturnal panic attack]). The determination of whether panic attacks are expected or unexpected is made by the clinician, who makes this judgment based on a combination of careful questioning as to the sequence of events preceding or leading up to the attack and the individual's own judgment of whether or not the attack seemed to occur for no apparent reason. Cultural interpretations may influence their determination as expected or unexpected. Culture-specific symptoms (e. g. , tinnitus, neck soreness, headache, uncontrollable screaming or crying) may be seen; however, such symptoms should not count as one of the four required symptoms. Panic attacks can occur in the context of any mental disorder (e. g. , anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, bipolar disorders, eating disorders, obsessive-compulsive and related disorders, personality disorders, psychotic disorders, substance use disorders) and some medical conditions (e. g. , cardiac, respiratory, vestibular, gastrointestinal), with the majority never meeting criteria for panic disorder. Recurrent unexpected panic attacks are required for a diagnosis of panic disorder. Recording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis: One type of unexpected panic attack is a nocturnal panic attack (i. e. , waking from sleep in a state of panic), which differs from panicking after fully waking from sleep. Panic attacks are related to a higher rate of suicide attempts and suicidal ideation even when comorbidity and other suicide risk factors are taken into account. Prevalence: In the general population, 12-month prevalence estimates for panic attacks in the United States is 11. 2% in adults. Twelve-month prevalence estimates do not appear to differ significantly among African Americans, Asian Americans, and Latinos. Lower 12-month prevalence estimates for European countries appear to range from 2. 7% to 3. 3%. Females are more frequently affected than males, although this gender difference is more pronounced for panic disorder. Panic attacks can occur in children but are relatively rare until the age of puberty, when the prevalence rates increase. The prevalence rates decline in older individuals, possibly reflecting diminishing severity to subclinical levels. Development And Course: The mean age at onset for panic attacks in the United States is approximately 22-23 years among adults. However, the course of panic attacks is likely influenced by the course of any co-occurring mental disorder(s) and stressful life events. Panic attacks are uncommon, and unexpected panic attacks are rare, in preadolescent children. Adolescents might be less willing than adults to openly discuss panic attacks, even though they present with episodes of intense fear or discomfort. Lower prevalence of panic attacks in older individuals may be related to a weaker autonomic response to emotional states relative to younger individuals. Older individuals may be less inclined to use the word \"fear\" and more inclined to use the word \"discomfort\" to describe panic attacks. Older individuals with \"panicky feelings\" may have a hybrid of limited-symptom attacks and generalized anxiety. In addition, older individuals tend to attribute panic attacks to certain situations that are stressful (e. g. , medical procedures, social settings) and may retrospectively endorse explanations for the panic attack even if it was unexpected in the moment. This may result in under-endorsement of unexpected panic attacks in older individuals\nRisk And Prognostic Factors: Temperamental. Negative affectivity (neuroticism) (i. e. , proneness to experiencing negative emotions) and anxiety sensitivity (i. e. , the disposition to believe that symptoms of anxiety are harmful) are risk factors for the onset of panic attacks. History of \"fearful spells\" (i. e. , limited-symptom attacks that do not meet full criteria for a panic attack) may be a risk factor for later panic attacks. Environmental. Smoking is a risk factor for panic attacks. Most individuals report identifiable stressors in the months before their first panic attack (e. g. , interpersonal stressors and stressors related to physical well-being, such as negative experiences with illicit or prescription drugs, disease, or death in the family). Culture Related Diagnostic Issues: Cultural interpretations may influence the determination of panic attacks as expected or unexpected. Culture-specific symptoms (e. g. , tinnitus, neck soreness, headache, and uncontrollable screaming or crying) may be seen; however, such symptoms should not count as one of the four required symptoms. Frequency of each of the 13 symptoms varies crossculturally (e. g. , higher rates of paresthesias in African Americans and of dizziness in several Asian groups). Cultural syndromes also influence the cross-cultural presentation of panic attacks, resulting in different symptom profiles across different cultural groups. Examples include khyal (wind) attacks, a Cambodian cultural syndrome involving dizziness, tinnitus, and neck soreness; and tr\u00f9nggi\u00f4 (wind-related) attacks, a Vietnamese cultural syndrome associated with headaches. Ataque de nervios (attack of nerves) is a cultural syndrome among Latin Americans that may involve trembling, uncontrollable screaming or crying, aggressive or suicidal behavior, and depersonalization or derealization, and which may be experienced for longer than only a few minutes. Some clinical presentations of ataque de nervios fulfill criteria for conditions other than panic attack (e. g. , other specified dissociative disorder). Also, cultural expectations may influence the classification of panic attacks as expected or unexpected, as cultural syndromes may create fear of certain situations, ranging from interpersonal arguments (associated with ataque de nervios), to types of exertion (associated with khy\u00e2l attacks), to atmospheric wind (associated with tr\u00f9nggi\u00f4 attacks). Clarification of the details of cultural attributions may aid in distinguishing expected and unexpected panic attacks. Gender Related Diagnostic Issues: Panic attacks are more common in females than in males, but clinical features or symptoms of panic attacks do not differ between males and females\nSuicide Risk:  \nFunctional Consequences: In the context of^co-occurring mental disorders, including anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, bipolar disorder, substance use disorders, psychotic disorders, and personality disorders, panic attacks are associated with increased symptom severity, higher rates of comorbidity and suicidality, and poorer treatment response. Also, full-symptom panic attacks typically are associated with greater morbidity (e. g. , greater health care utilization, more disability, poorer quality of life) than limited-symptom attacks\nDiagnostic Markers: Physiological recordings of naturally occurring panic attacks in individuals with panic disorder indicate abrupt surges of arousal, usually of heart rate, that reach a peak within minutes and subside within minutes, and for a proportion of these individuals the panic attack may be preceded by cardiorespiratory instabilities. Differential Diagnosis: Other paroxysmal episodes (e. g. , \u201canger attacks\u201d). Panic attacks should not be diagnosed if the episodes do not involve the essential feature of an abrupt surge of intense fear or intense discomfort, but rather other emotional states (e. g. , anger, grief). Anxiety disorder due to another medical condition. Medical conditions that can cause or be misdiagnosed as panic attacks include hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, pheochromocytoma, vestibular dysfunctions, seizure disorders, and cardiopulmonary conditions (e. g. , arrhythmias, supraventricular tachycardia, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). Appropriate laboratory tests (e. g. , serum calcium levels for hyperparathyroidism; Holter monitor for arrhythmias) or physical examinations (e. g. , for cardiac conditions) may be helpful in determining the etiological role of another medical condition. Substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder. Intoxication with central nervous system stimulants (e. g. , cocaine, amphetamines, caffeine) or cannabis and withdrawal from central nervous system depressants (e. g. , alcohol, barbiturates) can precipitate a panic attack. A detailed history should be taken to determine if the individual had panic attacks prior to excessive substance use. Features such as onset after age 45 years or the presence of atypical symptoms during a panic attack (e. g. , vertigo, loss of consciousness, loss of bladder or bowel control, slurred speech, or amnesia) suggest the possibility that a medical condition or a substance may be causing the panic attack symptoms. Panic disorder. Repeated unexpected panic attacks are required but are not sufficient for the diagnosis of panic disorder (i. e. , full diagnostic criteria for panic disorder must be met). Comorbidity: Panic attacks are associated with increased likelihood of various comorbid mental disorders, including anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, bipolar disorders, impulsecontrol disorders, and substance use disorders. Panic attacks are associated with increased likelihood of later developing anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, bipolar disorders, and possibly other disorders. Relationship To Other Classifications:.", "Disorder: Agoraphobia\nICD-9: 300. 22, ICD-10: F40. 00\nNotes: \nDiagnostic Criteria:\n  A: Marked fear or anxiety about two (or more) of the following five situations:\n    - {'dccd_id': '203', 'dcc_id': '212', 'parent_dccd_id': '0', 'dccd_key': '1', 'dccd_value': 'Using public transportation (e. g. , automobiles, buses, trains, ships, planes).

C: The agoraphobic situations almost always provoke fear or anxiety. D: The agoraphobic situations are actively avoided, require the presence of a companion, or are endured with intense fear or anxiety. E: The fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual danger posed by the agoraphobic situations and to the sociocultural context. F: The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, typically lasting for 6 months or more\n  G: The fear, anxiety, or avoidance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning\n  H: If another medical condition (e. g. , inflammatory bowel disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease) is present, the fear, anxiety, or avoidance is clearly excessive\n  I: The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is not better explained by the symptoms of another mental disorder\u2014for example, the symptoms are not confined to specific phobia, situational type; do not involve only social situations (as in social anxiety disorder): and are not related exclusively to obsessions (as in obsessive-compulsive disorder), perceived defects or flaws in physical appearance (as in body dysmorphic disorder), reminders of traumatic events (as in posttraumatic stress disorder), or fear of separation (as in separation anxiety disorder)\nDisorder Id: 56\nDiagnostic Features: The essential feature of agoraphobia is marked, or intense, fear or anxiety triggered by the real or anticipated exposure to a wide range of situations (Criterion A). The diagnosis requires endorsement of symptoms occurring in at least two of the following five situations: 1) using public transporation, such as automobiles, buses, trains, ships, or planes; 2) being in open spaces, such as parking lots, marketplaces, or bridges; 3) being in enclosed spaces, such as shops, theaters, or cinemas; 4) standing in line or being in a crowd; or 5) being outside of the home alone. The examples for each situation are not exhaustive; other situations may be feared. When experiencing fear and anxiety cued by such situations, individuals typically experience thoughts that something terrible might happen (Criterion B). Individuals frequently believe that escape from such situations might be difficult (e. g. , \"can't get out of here\") or that help might be unavailable (e. g. , \"there is nobody to help me\") when panic-like symptoms or other incapacitating or embarrassing symptoms occur. \"Panic-like symptoms\" refer to any of the 13 symptoms included in the criteria for panic attack, such as dizziness, faintness, and fear of dying. \"Other incapacitating or embarrassing symptoms\" include symptoms such as vomiting and inflammatory bowel symptoms, as well as, in older adults, a fear of falling or, in children, a sense of disorientation and getting lost. The amount of fear experienced may vary with proximity to the feared situation and may occur in anticipation of or in the actual presence of the agoraphobic situation. Also, the fear or anxiety may take the form of a full- or limited-symptom panic attack (i. e. , an expected panic attack). Fear or anxiety is evoked nearly every time the individual comes into contact with the feared situation (Criterion C). Thus, an individual who becomes anxious only occasionally in an agoraphobic situation (e. g. , becomes anxious when standing in line on only one out of every five occasions) would not be diagnosed with agoraphobia. The individual actively avoids the situation or, if he or she either is unable or decides not to avoid it, the situation evokes intense fear or anxiety (Criterion D). Active avoidance means the individual is currently behaving in ways that are intentionally designed to prevent or minimize contact with agoraphobic situations. Avoidance can be behavioral (e. g. , changing daily routines, choosing a job nearby to avoid using public transportation, arranging for food delivery to avoid entering shops and supermarkets) as well as cognitive (e. g. , using distraction to get through agoraphobic situations) in nature. The avoidance can become so severe that the person is completely homebound. Often, an individual is better able to confront a feared situation when accompanied by a companion, such as a partner, friend, or health professional. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance must be out of proportion to the actual danger posed by the agoraphobic situations and to the sociocultural context (Criterion E). Differentiating clinically significant agoraphobic fears from reasonable fears (e. g. , leaving the house during a bad storm) or from situations that are deemed dangerous (e. g. , walking in a parking lot or using public transportation in a high-crime area) is important for a number of reasons. First, what constitutes avoidance may be difficult to judge across cultures and sociocultural contexts (e. g. , it is socioculturally appropriate for orthodox Muslim women in certain parts of the world to avoid leaving the house alone, and thus such avoidance would not be considered indicative of agoraphobia). Second, older adults are likely to overattribute their fears to age-related constraints and are less likely to judge their fears as being out of proportion to the actual risk. Third, individuals with agoraphobia are likely to overestimate danger in relation to panic-like or other bodily symptoms. Agoraphobia should be diagnosed only if the fear, anxiety, or avoidance persists (Criterion F) and if it causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning (Criterion G). The duration of \"typically lasting for 6 months or more\" is meant to exclude individuals with short-lived, transient problems. However, the duration criterion should be used as a general guide, with allowance for some degree of flexibility. Recording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis: In its most severe forms, agoraphobia can cause individuals to become completely homebound, unable to leave their home and dependent on others for services or assistance to provide even for basic needs. Demoralization and depressive symptoms, as well as abuse of alcohol and sedative medication as inappropriate self-medication strategies, are common. Prevalence: Every year approximately 1. 7% of adolescents and adults have a diagnosis of agoraphobia. Females are twice as likely as males to experience agoraphobia. Agoraphobia may occur in childhood, but incidence peaks in late adolescence and early adulthood. Twelve-month prevalence in individuals older than 65 years is 0. 4%. Prevalence rates do not appear to vary systematically across cultural/racial groups. Development And Course: The percentage of individuals with agoraphobia reporting panic attacks or panic disorder preceding the onset of agoraphobia ranges from 30% in community samples to more than 50% in clinic samples. The majority of individuals with panic disorder show signs of anxiety and agoraphobia before the onset of panic disorder. In two-thirds of all cases of agoraphobia, initial onset is before age 35 years. There is a substantial incidence risk in late adolescence and early adulthood, with indications for a second high incidence risk phase after age 40 years. First onset in childhood is rare. The overall mean age at onset for agoraphobia is 17 years, although the age at onset without preceding panic attacks or panic disorder is 25-29 years. The course of agoraphobia is typically persistent and chronic. Complete remission is rare (10%), unless the agoraphobia is treated. With more severe agoraphobia, rates of full remission decrease, whereas rates of relapse and chronicity increase. A range of other disorders, in particular other anxiety disorders, depressive disorders, substance use disorders, and personality disorders, may complicate the course of agoraphobia. The long-term course and outcome of agoraphobia are associated with substantially elevated risk of secondary major depressive disorder, persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia), and substance use disorders. The clinical features of agoraphobia are relatively consistent across the lifespan, although the type of agoraphobic situations triggering fear, anxiety, or avoidance, as well as the type of cognitions, may vary. For example, in children, being outside of the home alone is the most frequent situation feared, whereas in older adults, being in shops, standing in line, and being in open spaces are most often feared. Also, cognitions often pertain to becoming lost (in children), to experiencing panic-like symptoms (in adults), to falling (in older adults). TTie low prevalence of agoraphobia in children could reflect difficulties in symptom reporting, and thus assessments in young children may require solicitation of information from multiple sources, including parents or teachers. Adolescents, particularly males, may be less willing than adults to openly discuss agoraphobic fears and avoidance; however, agoraphobia can occur prior to adulthood and should be assessed in children and adolescents. In older adults, comorbid somatic symptom disorders, as well as motor disturbances (e. g. , sense of falling or having medical complications), are frequently mentioned by individuals as the reason for their fear and avoidance. In these instances, care is to be taken in evaluating whether the fear and avoidance are out of proportion to the real danger involved\nRisk And Prognostic Factors: Temperamental. Behavioral inhibition and neurotic disposition (i. e. , negative affectivity [neuroticism] and anxiety sensitivity) are closely associated with agoraphobia but are relevant to most anxiety disorders (phobic disorders, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder). Anxiety sensitivity (the disposition to believe that symptoms of anxiety are harmful) is also characteristic of individuals with agoraphobia. Environmental. Negative events in childhood (e. g. , separation, death of parent) and other stressful events, such as being attacked or mugged, are associated with the onset of agoraphobia. Furthermore, individuals with agoraphobia describe the fannily climate and child-rearing behavior as being characterized by reduced warmth and increased overprotection. Genetic and physiological. Heritability for agoraphobia is 61%. Of the various phobias, agoraphobia has the strongest and most specific association with the genetic factor that represents proneness to phobias\nCulture Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nGender Related Diagnostic Issues: Females have different patterns of comorbid disorders than males. Consistent with gender differences in the prevalence of mental disorders, males have higher rates of comorbid substance use disorders. Suicide Risk:  \nFunctional Consequences: Agoraphobia is associated with considerable impairment and disability in terms of role functioning, work productivity, and disability days. Agoraphobia severity is a strong determinant of the degree of disability, irrespective of the presence of comorbid panic disorder, panic attacks, and other comorbid conditions. More than one-third of individuals with agoraphobia are completely homebound and unable to work. Diagnostic Markers:  \nDifferential Diagnosis: When diagnostic criteria for agoraphobia and another disorder are fully met, both diagnoses should be assigned, unless the fear, anxiety, or avoidance of agoraphobia is attributable to the other disorder. Weighting of criteria and clinical judgment may be helpful in some cases. Specific phobia, situational type. Differentiating agoraphobia from situational specific phobia can be challenging in some cases, because these conditions share several symptom characteristics and criteria. Specific phobia, situational type, should be diagnosed versus agoraphobia if the fear, anxiety, or avoidance is limited to one of the agoraphobic situations. Requiring fears from two or more of the agoraphobic situations is a robust means for differentiating agoraphobia from specific phobias, particularly the situational subtype. Additional differentiating features include the cognitive ideation. Thus, if the situation is feared for reasons other than panic-like symptoms or other incapacitating or embarrassing symptoms (e. g. , fears of being directly harmed by the situation itself, such as fear of the plane crashing for individuals who fear flying), then a diagnosis of specific phobia may be more appropriate. Separation anxiety disorder. Separation anxiety disorder can be best differentiated from agoraphobia by examining cognitive ideation. In separation anxiety disorder, the thoughts are about detachment from significant others and the home environment (i. e. , parents or other attachment figures), whereas in agoraphobia the focus is on panic-like symptoms or other incapacitating or embarrassing symptoms in the feared situations. Social anxiety disorder (social phobia). Agoraphobia should be differentiated from social anxiety disorder based primarily on the situational clusters that trigger fear, anxiety, or avoidance and the cognitive ideation. In social anxiety disorder, the focus is on fear of being negatively evaluated. Panic disorder. When criteria for panic disorder are met, agoraphobia should not be diagnosed if the avoidance behaviors associated with the panic attacks do not extend to avoidance of two or more agoraphobic situations. Acute stress disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder. Acute stress disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can be differentiated from agoraphobia by examining whether the fear, anxiety, or avoidance is related only to situations that remind the individual of a traumatic event. If the fear, anxiety, or avoidance is restricted to trauma reminders, and if the avoidance behavior does not extend to two or more agoraphobic situations, then a diagnosis of agoraphobia is not warranted. Major depressive disorder. In major depressive disorder, the individual may avoid leaving home because of apathy, loss of energy, low self-esteem, and anhedonia. If the avoidance is unrelated to fears of panic-like or other incapacitating or embarrassing symptoms, then agoraphobia should not be diagnosed. Other medical conditions. Agoraphobia is not diagnosed if the avoidance of situations is judged to be a physiological consequence of a medical condition. This determination is based on history, laboratory findings, and a physical examination. Other relevant medical conditions may include neurodegenerative disorders with associated motor disturbances (e. g. , Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis), as well as cardiovascular disorders. Individuals with certain medical conditions may avoid situations because of realistic concerns about being incapacitated (e. g. , fainting in an individual with transient ischemic attacks) or being embarrassed (e. g. , diarrhea in an individual with Crohn's disease). The diagnosis of agoraphobia should be given only when the fear or avoidance is clearly in excess of that usually associated with these medical conditions. Comorbidity: The majority of individuals with agoraphobia also have other mental disorders. The most frequent additional diagnoses are other anxiety disorders (e. g. , specific phobias, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder), depressive disorders (major depressive disorder), PTSD, and alcohol use disorder. Whereas other anxiety disorders (e. g. , separation anxiety disorder, specific phobias, panic disorder) frequently precede onset of agoraphobia, depressive disorders and substance use disorders typically occur secondary to agoraphobia\nRelationship To Other Classifications:.", "Disorder: Generalized Anxiety Disorder\nICD-9: 300. 02, ICD-10: F41. 1\nNotes: \nDiagnostic Criteria:\n  A: Excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation), occurring more days than not for at least 6 months, about a number of events or activities (such as work or school performance)\n  B: The individual finds it difficult to control the worry\n  C: The anxiety and worry are associated with three (or more) of the following six symptoms (with at least some symptoms having been present for more days than not for the past 6 months);\n    - {'dccd_id': '208', 'dcc_id': '223', 'parent_dccd_id': '0', 'dccd_key': '1', 'dccd_value': 'Restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge.

The intensity, duration, or frequency of the anxiety and worry is out of proportion to the actual likelihood or impact of the anticipated event. The individual finds it difficult to control the worry and to keep worrisome thoughts from interfering with attention to tasks at hand. Adults with generalized anxiety disorder often worry about everyday, routine life circumstances, such as possible job responsibilities, health and finances, the health of family members, misfortune to their children, or minor matters (e. g. , doing household chores or being late for appointments). Children with generalized anxiety disorder tend to worry excessively about their competence or the quality of their performance. During the course of the disorder, the focus of worry may shift from one concern to another. Several features distinguish generalized anxiety disorder from nonpathological anxiety. First, the worries associated with generalized anxiety disorder are excessive and typically interfere significantly with psychosocial functioning, whereas the worries of everyday life are not excessive and are perceived as more manageable and may be put off when more pressing matters arise. Second, the worries associated with generalized anxiety disorder are more pervasive, pronounced, and distressing; have longer duration; and frequently occur without pr\u00e9cipitants. The greater the range of life circumstances about which a person worries (e. g. , finances, children's safety, job performance), the more likely his or her symptoms are to meet criteria for generalized anxiety disorder. Third, everyday worries are much less likely to be accompanied by physical symptoms (e. g. , restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge). Individuals with generalized anxiety disorder report subjective distress due to constant worry and related impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The anxiety and worry are accompanied by at least three of the following additional symptoms: restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge, being easily fatigued, difficulty concentrating or mind going blank, irritability, muscle tension, and disturbed sleep, although only one additional symptom is required in children\nRecording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis: Associated with muscle tension, there may be trembling, twitching, feeling shaky, and muscle aches or soreness. Many individuals with generalized anxiety disorder also experience somatic symptoms (e. g. , sweating, nausea, diarrhea) and an exaggerated startle response. Symptoms of autonomic hyperarousal (e. g. , accelerated heart rate, shortness of breath, dizziness) are less prominent in generalized anxiety disorder than in other anxiety disorders, such as panic disorder. Other conditions that may be associated with stress (e. g. , irritable bowel syndrome, headaches) frequently accompany generalized anxiety disorder\nPrevalence: The 12-month prevalence of generalized anxiety disorder is 0. 9% among adolescents and 2. 9% among adults in the general community of the United States. The 12-month prevalence for the disorder in other countries ranges from 0. 4% to 3. 6%. The lifetime morbid risk is 9. 0%. Females are twice as likely as males to experience generalized anxiety disorder. The prevalence of the diagnosis peaks in middle age and declines across the later years of life. Individuals of European descent tend to experience generalized anxiety disorder more frequently than do individuals of non-European descent (i. e. , Asian, African, Native American and Pacific Islander). Furthermore, individuals from developed countries are more likely than individuals from nondeveloped countries to report that they have experienced symptoms that meet criteria for generalized anxiety disorder in their lifetime. Development And Course: Many individuals with generalized anxiety disorder report that they have felt anxious and nervous all of their lives. The median age at onset for generalized anxiety disorder is 30 years; however, age at onset is spread over a very broad range. The median age at onset is later than that for the other anxiety disorders. The symptoms of excessive worry and anxiety may occur early in life but are then manifested as an anxious temperament. Onset of the disorder rarely occurs prior to adolescence. The symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder tend to be chronic and wax and wane across the lifespan, fluctuating between syndromal and subsyndromal forms of the disorder. Rates of full remission are very low. The clinical expression of generalized anxiety disorder is relatively consistent across the lifespan. The primary difference across age groups is in the content of the individual's worry. Children and adolescents tend to worry more about school and sporting performance, whereas older adults report greater concern about the well-being of family or their own physical heath. Thus, the content of an individual's worry tends to be age appropriate. Younger adults experience greater severity of symptoms than do older adults. The earlier in life individuals have symptoms that meet criteria for generalized anxiety disorder, the more comorbidity they tend to have and the more impaired they are likely to be. The advent of chronic physical disease can be a potent issue for excessive worry in the elderly. In the frail elderly, worries about safety\u2014and especially about falling\u2014may limit activities. In those with early cognitive impairment, what appears to be excessive worry about, for example, the whereabouts of things is probably better regarded as realistic given the cognitive impairment. In children and adolescents with generalized anxiety disorder, the anxieties and worries often concern the quality of their performance or competence at school or in sporting events, even when their performance is not being evaluated by others. There may be excessive concerns about punctuality. They may also worry about catastrophic events, such as earthquakes or nuclear war. Children with the disorder may be overly conforming, perfectionist, and unsure of themselves and tend to redo tasks because of excessive dissatisfaction with less-than-perfect performance. They are typically overzealous in seeking reassurance and approval and require excessive reassurance about their performance and other things they are worried about. Generalized anxiety disorder may be overdiagnosed in children. When this diagnosis is being considered in children, a thorough evaluation for the presence of other childhood anxiety disorders and other mental disorders should be done to determine whether the worries may be better explained by one of these disorders. Separation anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder (social phobia), and obsessive-compulsive disorder are often accompanied by worries that may mimic those described in generalized anxiety disorder. For example, a child with social anxiety disorder may be concerned about school performance because of fear of humiliation. Worries about illness may also be better explained by separation anxiety disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder. Risk And Prognostic Factors: Temperamental. Behavioral inhibition, negative affectivity (neuroticism), and harm avoidance have been associated with generalized anxiety disorder. Environmental. Although childhood adversities and parental overprotection have been associated with generalized anxiety disorder, no environmental factors have been identified as specific to generalized anxiety disorder or necessary or sufficient for making the diagnosis. Genetic and physiological. One-third of the risk of experiencing generalized anxiety disorder is genetic, and these genetic factors overlap with the risk of neuroticism and are shared with other anxiety and mood disorders, particularly major depressive disorder. Culture Related Diagnostic Issues: There is considerable cultural variation in the expression of generalized anxiety disorder. For example, in some cultures, somatic symptoms predominate in the expression of the disorder, whereas in other cultures cognitive symptoms tend to predominate. This difference may be more evident on initial presentation than subsequently, as more symptoms are reported over time. There is no information as to whether the propensity for excessive worrying is related to culture, although the topic being worried about can be culture specific. It is important to consider the social and cultural context when evaluating whether worries about certain situations are excessive. Gender Related Diagnostic Issues: In clinical settings, generalized anxiety disorder is diagnosed somewhat more frequently in females than in males (about 55%-60% of those presenting with the disorder are female). In epidemiological studies, approximately two-thirds are female. Females and males who experience generalized anxiety disorder appear to have similar symptoms but demonstrate different patterns of comorbidity consistent with gender differences in the prevalence of disorders. In females, comorbidity is largely confined to the anxiety disorders and unipolar depression, whereas in males, comorbidity is more likely to extend to the substance use disorders as well. Suicide Risk:  \nFunctional Consequences: Excessive worrying impairs the individual's capacity to do things quickly and efficiently, whether at home or at work. The worrying takes time and energy; the associated symptoms of muscle tension and feeling keyed up or on edge, tiredness, difficulty concentrating, and disturbed sleep contribute to the impairment. Importantly the excessive worrying may impair the ability of individuals with generalized anxiety disorder to encourage confidence in their children. Generalized anxiety disorder is associated with significant disability and distress that is independent of comorbid disorders, and most non-institutionalized adults with the disorder are moderately to seriously disabled. Generalized anxiety disorder accounts for 110 million disability days per annum in the U. S. population. Diagnostic Markers:  \nDifferential Diagnosis: Anxiety disorder due to another medical condition. The diagnosis of anxiety disorder associated with another medical condition should be assigned if the individual's anxiety and worry are judged, based on history, laboratory findings, or physical examination, to be a physiological effect of another specific medical condition (e. g. , pheochromocytoma, hyperthyroidism). Substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder. A substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder is distinguished from generalized anxiety disorder by the fact that a substance or medication (e. g. , a drug of abuse, exposure to a toxin) is judged to be etiologically related to the anxiety. For example, severe anxiety that occurs only in the context of heavy coffee consumption would be diagnosed as caffeine-induced anxiety disorder. Social anxiety disorder. Individuals with social anxiety disorder often have anticipatory anxiety that is focused on upcoming social situations in which they must perform or be evaluated by others, whereas individuals with generalized anxiety disorder worry, whether or not they are being evaluated. Obsessive-compulsive disorder. Several features distinguish the excessive worry of generalized anxiety disorder from the obsessional thoughts of obsessive-compulsive disorder. In generalized anxiety disorder the focus of the worry is about forthcoming problems, and it is the excessiveness of the worry about future events that is abnormal. In obsessive-compulsive disorder, the obsessions are inappropriate ideas that take the form of intrusive and unwanted thoughts, urges, or images. Posttraumatic stress disorder and adjustment disorders. Anxiety is invariably present in posttraumatic stress disorder. Generalized anxiety disorder is not diagnosed if the anxiety and worry are better explained by symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder. Anxiety may also be present in adjustment disorder, but this residual category should be used only when the criteria are not met for any other disorder (including generalized anxiety disorder). Moreover, in adjustment disorders, the anxiety occurs in response to an identifiable stressor within 3 months of the onset of the stressor and does not persist for more than 6 months after the termination of the stressor or its consequences. Depressive, bipolar, and psychotic disorders. Generalized anxiety/worry is a common associated feature of depressive, bipolar, and psychotic disorders and should not be di- agnosed separately if the excessive worry has occurred only during the course of these conditions. Comorbidity: Individuals whose presentation meets criteria for generalized anxiety disorder are likely to have met, or currently meet, criteria for other anxiety and unipolar depressive disorders. The neuroticism or emotional liability that underpins this pattern of comorbidity is associated with temperamental antecedents and genetic and environmental risk factors shared between these disorders, although independent pathways are also possible. Comorbidity with substance use, conduct, psychotic, neurodevelopmental, and neurocognitive disorders is less common.

Such evidence of an independent anxiety disorder could include the following: The symptoms precede the onset of the substance/medication use; the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time (e. g. , about 1 month) atter the cessation of acute withdrawal or severe intoxication: or there is other evidence suggesting the existence of an independent non-substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder (e. g. , a history of recurrent non-substance/medication-related episodes\n  D: The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium. E: The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Disorder Id: 58\nDiagnostic Features: The essential features of substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder are prominent symptoms of panic or anxiety (Criterion A) that are judged to be due to the effects of a substance (e. g. , a drug of abuse, a medication, or a toxin exposure). The panic or anxiety symptoms must have developed during or soon after substance intoxication or withdrawal or after exposure to a medication, and the substances or medications must be capable of producing the symptoms (Criterion B2). Substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder due to a prescribed treatment for a mental disorder or another medical condition must have its onset while the individual is receiving the medication (or during withdrawal, if a withdrawal is associated with the medication). Once the treatment is discontinued, the panic or anxiety symptoms will usually improve or remit within days to several weeks to a month (depending on the half-life of the substance/medication and the presence of withdrawal). The diagnosis of substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder should not be given if the onset of the panic or anxiety symptoms precedes the substance/medication intoxication or withdrawal, or if the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time (i. e. , usually longer than 1 month) from the time of severe intoxication or withdrawal. If the panic or anxiety symptoms persist for substantial periods of time, other causes for the symptoms should be considered. The substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder diagnosis should be made instead of a diagnosis of substance intoxication or substance withdrawal only when the symptoms in Criterion A are predominant in the clinical picture and are sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention\nRecording Procedures: ICD-9-CM. The name of the substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder begins with the specific substance (e. g. , cocaine, salbutamol) that is presumed to be causing the anxiety symptoms. The diagnostic code is selected from the table included in the criteria set, which is based on the drug class. For substances that do not fit into any of the classes (e. g. , salbutamol), the code for \"other substance\" should be used; and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of substance is unknown, the category \"unknown substance\" should be used. The name of the disorder is followed by the specification of onset (i. e. , onset during intoxication, onset during withdrawal, with onset during medication use). Unlike the recording procedures for ICD-IO-CM, which combine the substance-induced disorder and substance use disorder into a single code, for ICD-9-CM a separate diagnostic code is given for the substance use disorder. For example, in the case of anxiety symptoms occurring during withdrawal in a man with a severe lorazepam use disorder, the diagnosis is 292. 89 lorazepam-induced anxiety disorder, with onset during withdrawal. An additional diagnosis of 304. 10 severe lorazepam use disorder is also given. When more than one substance is judged to play a significant role in the development of anxiety symptoms, each should be listed sep- arately (e. g. , 292. 89 methylphenidate-induced anxiety disorder, with onset during intoxication; 292. 89 salbutamol-induced anxiety disorder, with onset after medication use). ICD-10-CM. The name of the substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder begins with the specific substance (e. g. , cocaine, salbutamol) that is presumed to be causing the anxiety symptoms. The diagnostic code is selected from the table included in the criteria set, which is based on the drug class and presence or absence of a comorbid substance use disorder. For substances that do not fit into any of the classes (e. g. , salbutamol), the code for \"other substance\" should be used; and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of substance is unknown, the category \"unknown substance\" should be used. When recording the name of the disorder, the comorbid substance use disorder (if any) is listed first, followed by the word \"with,\" followed by the name of the substance-induced anxiety disorder, followed by the specification of onset (i. e. , onset during intoxication, onset during withdrawal, with onset during medication use). For example, in the case of anxiety symptoms occurring during withdrawal in a man with a severe lorazepam use disorder, the diagnosis is F13. 280 severe lorazepam use disorder with lorazepam-induced anxiety disorder, with onset during withdrawal. A separate diagnosis of the comorbid severe lorazepam use disorder is not given. If the substance-induced anxiety disorder occurs without a comorbid substance use disorder (e. g. , after a one-time heavy use of the substance), no accompanying substance use disorder is noted (e. g. , F16. 980 psilocybin-induced anxiety disorder, with onset during intoxication). When more than one substance is judged to play a significant role in the development of anxiety symptoms, each should be listed separately (e. g. , F15. 280 severe methylphenidate use disorder with methylphenidate-induced anxiety disorder, with onset during intoxication; F19. 980 salbutamol-induced anxiety disorder, with onset after medication use). Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis: Panic or anxiety can occur in association with intoxication with the following classes of substances: alcohol, caffeine, cannabis, phencyclidine, other hallucinogens, inhalants, stimu\u00ad lants (including cocaine), and other (or unknown) substances. Panic or anxiety can occur in association with withdrawal from the following classes of substances: alcohol; opioids; sedatives, hypnotics, and anxiolytics; stimulants (including cocaine); and other (or unknown) substances. Some medications that evoke anxiety symptoms include anesthetics and analgesics, sympathomimetics or other bronchodilators, anticholinergics, insulin, thyroid preparations, oral contraceptives, antihistamines, antiparkinsonian medications, corticosteroids, antihypertensive and cardiovascular medications, anticonvulsants, lithium carbonate, antipsychotic medications, and antidepressant medications. Heavy metals and toxins (e. g. , organophosphate insecticide, nerve gases, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, volatile substances such as gasoline and paint) may also cause panic or anxiety symptoms. Prevalence: The prevalence of substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder is not clear. General population data suggest that it may be rare, with a 12-month prevalence of approximately 0. 002%. However, in clinical populations, the prevalence is likely to be higher. Development And Course:  \nRisk And Prognostic Factors:  \nCulture Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nGender Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nSuicide Risk:  \nFunctional Consequences:  \nDiagnostic Markers: Laboratory assessments (e. g. , urine toxicology) may be useful to measure substance intoxication as part of an assessment for substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder. Differential Diagnosis: Substance intoxication and substance withdrawal. Anxiety symptoms commonly occur in substance intoxication and substance withdrawal. The diagnosis of the substancespecific intoxication or substance-specific withdrawal will usually suffice to categorize the symptom presentation. A diagnosis of substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder should be made in addition to substance intoxication or substance withdrawal when the panic or anxiety symptoms are predominant in the clinical picture and are sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention. For example, panic or anxiety symptoms are characteristic of alcohol withdrawal. Anxiety disorder (i. e. , not induced by a substance/medication). Substance/medicationinduced anxiety disorder is judged to be etiologically related to the substance/medication. Substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder is distinguished from a primary anxiety disorder based on the onset, course, and other factors with respect to substances/medications. For drugs of abuse, there must be evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings for use, intoxication, or withdrawal. Substance/medication-induced anxiety disorders arise only in association with intoxication or withdrawal states, whereas primary anxiety disorders may precede the onset of substance/medication use. The presence of features that are atypical of a primary anxiety disorder, such as atypical age at onset (e. g. , onset of panic disorder after age 45 years) or symptoms (e. g. , atypical panic attack symptoms such as true vertigo, loss of balance, loss of consciousness, loss of bladder control, headaches, slurred speech) may suggest a substance/medication-induced etiology. A primary anxiety disorder diagnosis is warranted if the panic or anxiety symptoms persist for a substantial period of time (about 1 month or longer) after the end of the substance intoxication or acute withdrawal or there is a history of an anxiety disorder. Delirium. If panic or anxiety symptoms occur exclusively during the course of delirium, they are considered to be an associated feature of the delirium and are not diagnosed separately. Anxiety disorder due to another medical condition. If the panic or anxiety symptoms are attributed to the physiological consequences of another medical condition (i. e. , rather than to the medication taken for the medical condition), anxiety disorder due to another medical condition should be diagnosed. The history often provides the basis for such a judgment. At times, a change in the treatment for the other medical condition (e. g. , medication substitution or discontinuation) may be needed to determine whether the medication is the causative agent (in which case the symptoms may be better explained by substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder). If the disturbance is attributable to both another medical condition and substance use, both diagnoses (i. e. , anxiety disorder due to another medical condition and substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder) may be given. When there is insufficient evidence to determine whether the panic or anxiety symptoms are attributable to a substance/medication or to another medical condition or are primary (i. e. , not attributable to either a substance or another medical condition), a diagnosis of other specified or unspecified anxiety disorder would be indicated.

A: Panic attacks or anxiety is predominant in the clinical picture\n  B: There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings that the disturbance is the direct pathophysiological consequence of another medical condition\n  C: The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder\n  D: The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium\n  E: The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Disorder Id: 59\nDiagnostic Features: The essential feature of anxiety disorder due to another medical condition is clinically significant anxiety that is judged to be best explained as a physiological effect of another medical condition. Symptoms can include prominent anxiety symptoms or panic attacks (Criterion A). The judgment that the symptoms are best explained by the associated physical condition must be based on evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings (Criterion B). Additionally, it must be judged that the symptoms are not better accounted for by another mental disorder, in particular, adjustment disorder, with anxiety, in which the stressor is the medical condition (Criterion C). In this case, an individual with adjustment disorder is especially distressed about the meaning or the consequences of the associated medical condition. By contrast, there is often a prominent physical component to the anxiety (e. g. , shortness of breath) when the anxiety is due to another medical condition. The diagnosis is not made if the anxiety symptoms occur only during the course of a delirium (Criterion D). The anxiety symptoms must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning (Criterion E). In determining whether the anxiety symptoms are attributable to another medical condition, the clinician must first establish the presence of the medical condition. Furthermore, it must be established that anxiety symptoms can be etiologically related to the medical condition through a physiological mechanism before making a judgment that this is the best explanation for the symptoms in a specific individual. A careful and compre\u00ad hensive assessment of multiple factors is necessary to make this judgment. Several aspects of the clinical presentation should be considered: 1) the presence of a clear temporal association between the onset, exacerbation, or remission of the medical condition and the anxiety symptoms; 2) the presence of features that are atypical of a primary anxiety disorder (e. g. , atypical age at onset or course); and 3) evidence in the literature that a known physiological mechanism (e. g. , hyperthyroidism) causes anxiety. In addition, the disturbance must not be better explained by a primary anxiety disorder, a substance/medicationinduced anxiety disorder, or another primary mental disorder (e. g. , adjustment disorder). Recording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis: A number of medical conditions are known to include anxiety as a symptomatic manifestation. Examples include endocrine disease (e. g. , hyperthyroidism, pheochromocytoma, hypoglycemia, hyperadrenocortisolism), cardiovascular disorders (e. g. , congestive heart failure, pulmonary embolism, arrhythmia such as atrial fibrillation), respiratory illness (e. g. , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, pneumonia), metabolic disturbances (e. g. , vitamin B^2 deficiency, porphyria), and neurological illness (e. g. , neoplasms, vestibular dysfunction, encephalitis, seizure disorders). Anxiety due to another medical condition is diagnosed when the medical condition is known to induce anxiety and when the medical condition preceded the onset of the anxiety. Prevalence: The prevalence of anxiety disorder due to another medical condition is unclear. There appears to be an elevated prevalence of anxiety disorders among individuals with a variety of medical conditions, including asthma, hypertension, ulcers, and arthritis. However, this increased prevalence may be due to reasons other than the anxiety disorder directly causing the medical condition\nDevelopment And Course: The development and course of anxiety disorder due to another medical condition generally follows the course of the underlying illness. This diagnosis is not meant to include primary anxiety disorders that arise in the context of chronic medical illness. This is important to consider with older adults, who may experience chronic medical illness and then develop independent anxiety disorders secondary to the chronic medical illness. Risk And Prognostic Factors:  \nCulture Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nGender Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nSuicide Risk:  \nFunctional Consequences:  \nDiagnostic Markers: Laboratory assessments and/or medical examinations are necessary to confirm the diagnosis of the associated medical condition\nDifferential Diagnosis: Delirium. A separate diagnosis of anxiety disorder due to another medical condition is not given if the anxiety disturbance occurs exclusively during the course of a delirium. However, a diagnosis of anxiety disorder due to another medical condition may be given in addition to a diagnosis of major neurocognitive disorder (dementia) if the etiology of anxiety is judged to be a physiological consequence of the pathological process causing the neurocognitive disorder and if anxiety is a prominent part of the clinical presentation. Mixed presentation of symptoms (e. g. , mood and anxiety). If the presentation includes a mix of different types of symptoms, the specific mental disorder due to another medical condition depends on which symptoms predominate in the clinical picture. Substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder. If there is evidence of recent or prolonged substance use (including medications with psychoactive effects), withdrawal from a substance, or exposure to a toxin, a substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder should be considered. Certain medications are known to increase anxiety (e. g. , corticosteroids, estrogens, metoclopramide), and when this is the case, the medication may be the most likely etiology, although it may be difficult to distinguish whether the anxiety is attributable to the medications or to the medical illness itself. When a diagnosis of substanceinduced anxiety is being made in relation to recreational or nonprescribed drugs, it may be useful to obtain a urine or blood drug screen or other appropriate laboratory evaluation. Symptoms that occur during or shortly after (i. e. , within 4 weeks of) substance intoxication or withdrawal or after medication use may be especially indicative of a substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder, depending on the type, duration, or amount of the substance used. If the disturbance is associated with both another medical condition and substance use, both diagnoses (i. e. , anxiety disorder due to another medical condition and substance/medication-induced anxiety disorder) can be given. Features such as onset after age 45 years or the presence of atypical symptoms during a panic attack (e. g. , vertigo, loss of consciousness, loss of bladder or bowel control, slurred speech, amnesia) suggest the possibility that another medical condition or a substance may be causing the panic attack symptoms. Anxiety disorder (not due to a known medical condition). Anxiety disorder due to another medical condition should be distinguished from other anxiety disorders (especially panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder). In other anxiety disorders, no specific and direct causative physiological mechanisms associated with another medical condition can be demonstrated. Late age at onset, atypical symptoms, and the absence of a personal or family history of anxiety disorders suggest the need for a thorough assessment to rule out the diagnosis of anxiety disorder due to another medical condition. Anxiety disorders can exacerbate or pose increased risk for medical conditions such as cardiovascular events and myocardial infarction and should not be diagnosed as anxiety disorder due to another medical condition in these cases. Illness anxiety disorder. Anxiety disorder due to another medical condition should be distinguished from illness anxiety disorder. Illness anxiety disorder is characterized by worry about illness, concern about pain, and bodily preoccupations. In the case of illness anxiety disorder, individuals may or may not have diagnosed medical conditions. Although an individual with illness anxiety disorder and a diagnosed medical condition is likely to experience anxiety about the medical condition, the medical condition is not physiologically related to the anxiety symptoms. Adjustment disorders. Anxiety disorder due to another medical condition should be distinguished from adjustment disorders, with anxiety, or with anxiety and depressed mood. Adjustment disorder is warranted when individuals experience a maladaptive response to the stress of having another medical condition. The reaction to stress usually concerns the meaning or consequences of the stress, as compared with the experience of anxiety or mood symptoms that occur as a physiological consequence of the other medical condition. In adjustment disorder, the anxiety symptoms are typically related to coping with the stress of having a general medical condition, whereas in anxiety disorder due to another medical condition, individuals are more likely to have prominent physical symptoms and to be focused on issues other than the stress of the illness itself. Associated feature of another mental disorder. Anxiety symptoms may be an associated feature of another mental disorder (e. g. , schizophrenia, anorexia nervosa). Other specified or unspecified anxiety disorder. This diagnosis is given if it cannot be determined whether the anxiety symptoms are primary, substance-induced, or associated with another medical condition.

Disorder Id: 62\nDiagnostic Features: The characteristic symptoms of OCD are the presence of obsessions and compulsions (Criterion A). Obsessions are repetitive and persistent thoughts (e. g. , of contamination), images (e. g. , of violent or horrific scenes), or urges (e. g. , to stab someone). Importantly, obsessions are not pleasurable or experienced as voluntary: they are intrusive and unwanted and cause marked distress or anxiety in most individuals. The individual attempts to ignore or suppress these obsessions (e. g. , avoiding triggers or using thought suppression) or to neutralize them with another thought or action (e. g. , performing a compulsion). Compulsions (or rituals) are repetitive behaviors (e. g. , washing, checking) or mental acts (e. g. , counting, repeating words silently) that the individual feels driven to perform in response to an obsession or according to rules that must be applied rigidly. Most individuals with OCD have both obsessions and compulsions. Compulsions are typically performed in response to an obsession (e. g. , thoughts of contamination leading to washing rituals or that something is incorrect leading to repeating rituals until it feels \"just right\")\u00b7 The aim is to reduce the distress triggered by obsessions or to prevent a feared event (e. g. , becoming ill). However, these compulsions either are not connected in a realistic way to the feared event (e. g. , arranging items symmetrically to prevent harm to a loved one) or are clearly excessive (e. g. , showering for hours each day). Compulsions are not done for pleasure, although some individuals experience relief from anxiety or distress. Criterion B emphasizes that obsessions and compulsions must be time-consuming (e. g. , more than 1 hour per day) or cause clinically significant distress or impairment to warrant a diagnosis of OCD. This criterion helps to distinguish the disorder from the occasional intmsive thoughts or repetitive behaviors that are common in the general population (e. g. , double-checking that a door is locked). The frequency and severity of obsessions and compulsions vary across individuals with OCD (e. g. , some have mild to moderate symptoms, spending 1-3 hours per day obsessing or doing compulsions, whereas others have nearly constant intmsive thoughts or compulsions that can be incapacitating). Recording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis: The specific content of obsessions and compulsions varies between individuals. However, certain themes, or dimensions, are common, including those of cleaning (contamination obsessions and cleaning compulsions); symmetry (symmetry obsessions and repeating. ordering, and counting compulsions); forbidden or taboo thoughts (e. g. , aggressive, sexual, or religious obsessions and related compulsions); and harm (e. g. , fears of harm to oneself or others and checking compulsions). Some individuals also have difficulties discarding and accumulate (hoard) objects as a consequence of typical obsessions and compulsions, such as fears of harming others. These themes occur across different cultures, are relatively consistent over time in adults w^ith the disorder, and may be associated v^ith different neural substrates. Importantly, individuals often have symptoms in more than one dimension. Individuals with OCD experience a range of affective responses when confronted with situations that trigger obsessions and compulsions. For example, many individuals experience marked anxiety that can include recurrent panic attacks. Others report strong feelings of disgust. While performing compulsions, some individuals report a distressing sense of \"incompleteness\" or uneasiness until things look, feel, or sound \"just right. \" It is common for individuals with the disorder to avoid people, places, and things that trigger obsessions and compulsions. For example, individuals with contamination concerns might avoid public situations (e. g. , restaurants, public restrooms) to reduce exposure to feared contaminants; individuals with intrusive thoughts about causing harm might avoid social interactions. Prevalence: The 12-month prevalence of OCD in the United States is 1. 2%, with a similar prevalence internationally (1. 1%-1. 8%). Females are affected at a shghtly higher rate than males in adulthood, although males are more commonly affected in childhood. Development And Course: In the United States, the mean age at onset of OCD is 19. 5 years, and 25% of cases start by age 14 years. Onset after age 35 years is unusual but does occur. Males have an earlier age at onset than females: nearly 25% of males have onset before age 10 years. The onset of symptoms is typically gradual; however, acute onset has also been reported. If OCD is untreated, the course is usually chronic, often with waxing and waning symptoms. Some individuals have an episodic course, and a minority have a deteriorating course. Without treatment, remission rates in adults are low (e. g. , 20% for those reevaluated 40 years later). Onset in childhood or adolescence can lead to a lifetime of OCD. However, 40% of individuals with onset of OCD in childhood or adolescence may experience remission by early adulthood. The course of OCD is often complicated by the co-occurrence of other disorders (see section \"Comorbidity\" for this disorder). Compulsions are more easily diagnosed in children than obsessions are because compulsions are observable. However, most children have both obsessions and compulsions (as do most adults). The pattern of symptoms in adults can be stable over time, but it is more variable in children. Some differences in the content of obsessions and compulsions have been reported when children and adolescent samples have been compared with adult samples. These differences likely reflect content appropriate to different developmental stages (e. g. , higher rates of sexual and religious obsessions in adolescents than in children; higher rates of harm obsessions [e. g. , fears of catastrophic events, such as death or illness to self or loved ones] in children and adolescents than in adults). Risk And Prognostic Factors: Temperamental. Greater internalizing symptoms, higher negative emotionality, and behavioral inhibition in childhood are possible temperamental risk factors. Environmental. Physical and sexual abuse in childhood and other stressful or traumatic events have been associated with an increased risk for developing OCD. Some children may develop the sudden onset of obsessive-compulsive symptoms, v^hich has been associated with different environmental factors, including various infectious agents and a post-infectious autoimmune syndrome. Genetic and physiological. The rate of OCD among first-degree relatives of adults with OCD is approximately two times that among first-degree relatives of those without the disorder; however, among first-degree relatives of individuals with onset of OCD in childhood or adolescence, the rate is increased 10-fold. Familial transmission is due in part to genetic factors (e. g. , a concordance rate of 0. 57 for monozygotic vs. 0. 22 for dizygotic twins). Dysfunction in the orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and striatum have been most strongly implicated\nCulture Related Diagnostic Issues: OCD occurs across the world. There is substantial similarity across cultures in the gender distribution, age at onset, and comorbidity of OCD. Moreover, around the globe, there is a similar symptom structure involving cleaning, symmetry, hoarding, taboo thoughts, or fear of harm. However, regional variation in symptom expression exists, and cultural factors may shape the content of obsessions and compulsions. Gender Related Diagnostic Issues: Males have an earlier age at onset of OCD than females and are more likely to have comorbid tic disorders. Gender differences in the pattern of symptom dimensions have been reported, with, for example, females more likely to have symptoms in the cleaning dimension and males more likely to have symptoms in the forbidden thoughts and symmetry dimensions. Onset or exacerbation of OCD, as well as symptoms that can interfere with the mother-infant relationship (e. g. , aggressive obsessions leading to avoidance of the infant), have been reported in the p\u00e9ripartum period. Suicide Risk: Suicidal thoughts occur at some point in as many as about half of individuals with OCD. Suicide attempts are also reported in up to one-quarter of individuals with OCD; the presence of comorbid major depressive disorder increases the risk\nFunctional Consequences: OCD is associated with reduced quality of life as well as high levels of social and occupational impairment. Impairment occurs across many different domains of life and is associated with symptom severity. Impairment can be caused by the time spent obsessing and doing compulsions. Avoidance of situations that can trigger obsessions or compulsions can also severely restrict functioning. In addition, specific symptoms can create specific obstacles. For example, obsessions about harm can make relationships with family and friends feel hazardous; the result can be avoidance of these relationships. Obsessions about symmetry can derail the timely completion of school or work projects because the project never feels \"just right,\" potentially resulting in school failure or job loss. Health consequences can also occur. For example, individuals with contamination concerns may avoid doctors' offices and hospitals (e. g. , because of fears of exposure to germs) or develop dermatological problems (e. g. , skin lesions due to excessive washing). Sometimes the symptoms of the disorder interfere with its own treatment (e. g. , when medications are considered contaminated). When the disorder starts in childhood or adolescence, individuals may experience developmental difficulties. For example, adolescents may avoid socializing with peers; young adults may struggle when they leave home to live independently. The result can be few significant relationships outside the family and a lack of autonomy and financial independence from their family of origin. In addition, some individuals with OCD try to impose rules and prohibitions on family members because of their disorder (e. g. , no one in the family can have visitors to the house for fear of contamination), and this can lead to family dysfunction\nDiagnostic Markers:  \nDifferential Diagnosis: Anxiety disorders. Recurrent thoughts, avoidant behaviors, and repetitive requests for reassurance can also occur in anxiety disorders. However, the recurrent thoughts that are present in generalized anxiety disorder (i. e. , worries) are usually about real-life concerns, whereas the obsessions of OCD usually do not involve real-life concerns and can include content that is odd, irrational, or of a seemingly magical nature; moreover, compulsions are often present and usually linked to the obsessions. Like individuals with OCD, individuals with specific phobia can have a fear reaction to specific objects or situations; however, in specific phobia the feared object is usually much more circumscribed, and rituals are not present. In social anxiety disorder (social phobia), the feared objects or situations are limited to social interactions, and avoidance or reassurance seeking is focused on reducing this social fear. Major depressive disorder. OCD can be distinguished from the rumination of major depressive disorder, in which thoughts are usually mood-congruent and not necessarily experienced as intrusive or distressing; moreover, ruminations are not linked to compulsions, as is typical in OCD. Other obsessive-compulsive and related disorders. In body dysmorphic disorder, the obsessions and compulsions are limited to concerns about physical appearance; and in trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder), the compulsive behavior is limited to hair pulling in the absence of obsessions. Hoarding disorder symptoms focus exclusively on the persistent difficulty discarding or parting with possessions, marked distress associated with discarding items, and excessive accumulation of objects. However, if an individual has obsessions that are typical of OCD (e. g. , concerns about incompleteness or harm), and these obsessions lead to compulsive hoarding behaviors (e. g. , acquiring all objects in a set to attain a sense of completeness or not discarding old newspapers because they may contain information that could prevent harm), a diagnosis of OCD should be given instead. Eating disorders. OCD can be distinguished from anorexia nervosa in that in OCD the obsessions and compulsions are not limited to concerns about weight and food. Tics (in tic disorder) and stereotyped movements. A tic is a sudden, rapid, recurrent, nonrhythmic motor movement or vocalization (e. g. , eye blinking, throat clearing). A stereotyped movement is a repetitive, seemingly driven, nonfunctional motor behavior (e. g. , head banging, body rocking, self-biting). Tics and stereotyped movements are typically less complex than compulsions and are not aimed at neutralizing obsessions. However, distinguishing between complex tics and compulsions can be difficult. Whereas compulsions are usually preceded by obsessions, tics are often preceded by premonitory sensory urges. Some individuals have symptoms of both OCD and a tic disorder, in which case both diagnoses may be warranted. Psychotic disorders. Some individuals with OCD have poor insight or even delusional OCD beliefs. However, they have obsessions and compulsions (distinguishing their condition from delusional disorder) and do not have other features of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder (e. g. , hallucinations or formal thought disorder). Other compulsive-like behaviors. Certain behaviors are sometimes described as ''compulsive,\" including sexual behavior (in the case of paraphilias), gambling (i. e. , gambling disorder), and substance use (e. g. , alcohol use disorder). However, these behaviors differ from the compulsions of OCD in that the person usually derives pleasure from the activity and may wish to resist it only because of its deleterious consequences. Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. Although obsessive-compulsive personality disorder and OCD have similar names, the clinical manifestations of these disorders are quite different. Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder is not characterized by intrusive thoughts, images, or urges or by repetitive behaviors that are performed in response to these intrusions; instead, it involves an enduring and pervasive maladaptive pattern of excessive perfectionism and rigid control. If an individual manifests symptoms of both OCD and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, both diagnoses can be given. Comorbidity: Individuals with OCD often have other psychopathology. Many adults with the disorder have a lifetime diagnosis of an anxiety disorder (76%; e. g. , panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, specific phobia) or a depressive or bipolar disorder (63% for any depressive or bipolar disorder, with the most common being major depressive disorder [41%]). Onset of OCD is usually later than for most comorbid anxiety disorders (with the exception of separation anxiety disorder) and PTSD but often precedes that of depressive disorders. Comorbid obsessive-compulsive personality disorder is also common in individuals with OCD (e. g. , ranging from 23% to 32%). Up to 30% of individuals with OCD also have a lifetime tic disorder. A comorbid tic disorder is most common in males with onset of OCD in childhood. These individuals tend to differ from those without a history of tic disorders in the themes of their OCD symptoms, comorbidity, course, and pattern of familial transmission. A triad of OCD, tic disorder, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder can also be seen in children. Disorders that occur more frequently in individuals with OCD than in those without the disorder include several obsessive-compulsive and related disorders such as body dysmorphic disorder, trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder), and excoriation (skin-picking) disorder. Finally, an association between OCD and some disorders characterized by impulsivity, such as oppositional defiant disorder, has been reported. OCD is also much more common in individuals with certain other disorders than would be expected based on its prevalence in the general population; when one of those other disorders is diagnosed, the individual should be assessed for OCD as well. For example, in individuals with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, the prevalence of OCD is approximately 12%. Rates of OCD are also elevated in bipolar disorder; eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa; and Tourette's disorder.

The perceived flaws are not observable or appear only slight to other individuals. Concerns range from looking \"unattractive\" or \"not right\" to looking \"hideous\" or \"like a monster. \" Preoccupations can focus on one or many body areas, most commonly the skin (e. g. , perceived acne, scars, lines, wrinkles, paleness), hair (e. g. , \"thinning\" hair or \"excessive\" body or facial hair), or nose (e. g. , size or shape). However, any body area can be the focus of concern (e. g. , eyes, teeth, weight, stomach, breasts, legs, face size or shape, lips, chin, eyebrows, genitals). Some individuals are concerned about perceived asymmetry of body areas. The preoccupations are intrusive, unwanted, time-consuming (occurring, on average, 3-8 hours per day), and usually difficult to resist or control. Excessive repetitive behaviors or mental acts (e. g. , comparing) are performed in response to the preoccupation (Criterion B). The individual feels driven to perform these behaviors, which are not pleasurable and may increase anxiety and dysphoria. They are typically time-consuming and difficult to resist or control. Common behaviors are comparing one's appearance with that of other individuals; repeatedly checking perceived defects in mirrors or other reflecting surfaces or examining them directly; excessively grooming (e. g. , combing, styling, shaving, plucking, or pulling hair); camouflaging (e. g. , repeatedly applying makeup or covering disliked areas with such things as a hat, clothing, makeup, or hair); seeking reassurance about how the perceived flaws look; touching disliked areas to check them; excessively exercising or weight lifting; and seeking cosmetic procedures. Some individuals excessively tan (e. g. , to darken \"pale\" skin or diminish perceived acne), repeatedly change their clothes (e. g. , to camouflage perceived defects), or compulsively shop (e. g. , for beauty products). Compulsive skin picking intended to improve perceived skin defects is common and can cause skin damage, infections, or ruptured blood vessels. The preoccupation must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning (Criterion C); usually both are present. Body dysmo\u03c6hic disorder must be differentiated from an eating disorder. Muscle dysmorphia, a form of body dysmo\u03c6hic disorder occurring almost exclusively in males, consists of preoccupation with the idea that one's body is too small or insufficiently lean or muscular. Individuals with this form of the disorder actually have a normal-looking body or are even very muscular. They may also be preoccupied with other body areas, such as skin or hair. A majority (but not all) diet, exercise, and/or lift weights excessively, sometimes causing bodily damage. Some use potentially dangerous anabolic- androgenic steroids and other substances to try to make their body bigger and more muscular. Body dysmorphic disorder by proxy is a form of body dysmorphic disorder in which individuals are preoccupied with defects they perceive in another person's appearance. Insight regarding body dysmorphic disorder beliefs can range from good to absent/ delusional (i. e. , delusional beliefs consisting of complete conviction that the individual's view of their appearance is accurate and undistorted). On average, insight is poor; onethird or more of individuals currently have delusional body dysmorphic disorder beliefs. Individuals with delusional body dysmorphic disorder tend to have greater morbidity in some areas (e. g. , suicidality), but this appears accounted for by their tendency to have more severe body dysmorphic disorder symptoms\nRecording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis: Many individuals with body dysmorphic disorder have ideas or delusions of reference, believing that other people take special notice of them or mock them because of how they look. Body dysmorphic disorder is associated with high levels of anxiety, social anxiety, social avoidance, depressed mood, neuroticism, and perfectionism as well as low extroversion and low self-esteem. Many individuals are ashamed of their appearance and their excessive focus on how they look, and are reluctant to reveal their concerns to others. A majority of individuals receive cosmetic treatment to try to improve their perceived defects. Dermatological treatment and surgery are most common, but any type (e. g. , dental, electrolysis) may be received. Occasionally, individuals may perform surgery on themselves. Body dysmorphic disorder appears to respond poorly to such treatments and sometimes becomes worse. Some individuals take legal action or are violent toward the clinician because they are dissatisfied with the cosmetic outcome. Body dysmorphic disorder has been associated with executive dysfunction and visual processing abnormalities, with a bias for analyzing and encoding details rather than holistic or configurai aspects of visual stimuli. Individuals with this disorder tend to have a bias for negative and threatening interpretations of facial expressions and ambiguous scenarios\nPrevalence: The point prevalence among U. S. adults is 2. 4% (2. 5% in females and 2. 2% in males). Outside the United States (i. e. , Germany), current prevalence is approximately 1. 7%-1,8%, with a gender distribution similar to that in the United States. The current prevalence is 9%-15% among dermatology patients, 7%-8% among U. S. cosmetic surgery patients, 3%- 16% among international cosmetic surgery patients (most studies), 8% among adult orthodontia patients, and 10% among patients presenting for oral or maxillofacial surgery. Development And Course: The mean age at disorder onset is 16-17 years, the median age at onset is 15 years, and the most common age at onset is 12-13 years. Two-thirds of individuals have disorder onset before age 18. Subclinical body dysmorphic disorder symptoms begin, on average, at age 12 or 13 years. Subclinical concerns usually evolve gradually to the full disorder, although some individuals experience abrupt onset of body dysmorphic disorder. The disorder appears to usually be chronic, although improvement is likely when evidence-based treatment is received. The disorder's clinical features appear largely similar in children/ adolescents and adults. Body dysmo\u03c6hic disorder occurs in the elderly, but little is known about the disorder in this age group. Individuals with disorder onset before age 18 years are more likely to attempt suicide, have more comorbidity, and have gradual (rather than acute) disorder onset than those with adult-onset body dysmorphic disorder. Risk And Prognostic Factors: Environmental. \" Body dysmorphic disorder has been associated with high rates of childhood neglect and abuse. Genetic and physiological. The prevalence of body dysmorphic disorder is elevated in first-degree relatives of individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Culture Related Diagnostic Issues: Body dysmorphic disorder has been reported internationally. It appears that the disorder may have more similarities than differences across races and cultures but that cultural values and preferences may influence symptom content to some degree. Taijin kyofusho, included in the traditional Japanese diagnostic system, has a subtype similar to body dysmorphic disorder: shubo-kyofu (\"the phobia of a deformed body\"). Gender Related Diagnostic Issues: Females and males appear to have more similarities than differences in terms of most clinical features\u2014 for example, disliked body areas, types of repehtive behaviors, symptom severity, suicidality, comorbidity, illness course, and receipt of cosmetic procedures for body dysmorphic disorder. However, males are more likely to have genital preoccupations, and females are more likely to have a comorbid eating disorder. Muscle dysmorphia occurs almost exclusively in males. Suicide Risk: Rates of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts are high in both adults and children/adolescents with body dysmorphic disorder. Furthermore, risk for suicide appears high in adolescents. A substantial proportion of individuals attribute suicidal ideation or suicide attempts primarily to their appearance concerns. Individuals with body dysmorphic disorder have many risk factors for completed suicide, such as high rates of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts, demographic characteristics associated with suicide, and high rates of comorbid major depressive disorder\nFunctional Consequences: Nearly all individuals with body dysmorphic disorder experience impaired psychosocial functioning because of their appearance concerns. Impairment can range from moderate (e. g. , avoidance of some social situations) to extreme and incapacitating (e. g. , being completely housebound). On average, psychosocial functioning and quality of life are markedly poor. More severe body dysmorphic disorder symptoms are associated with poorer functioning and quality of life. Most individuals experience impairment in their job, academic, or role functioning (e. g. , as a parent or caregiver), which is often severe (e. g. , performing poorly, missing school or work, not working). About 20% of youths with body dysmorphic disorder report dropping out of school primarily because of their body dysmorphic disorder symptoms. Impairment in social functioning (e. g. , social activities, relationships, intimacy), including avoidance, is common. Individuals may be housebound because of their body dysmorphic disorder symptoms, sometimes for years. A high proportion of adults and adolescents have been psychiatrically hospitalized. Diagnostic Markers:  \nDifferential Diagnosis: Normal appearance concerns and clearly noticeable physical defects. Body dysmorphic disorder differs from normal appearance concerns in being characterized by exces\u00ad sive appearance-related preoccupations and repetitive behaviors that are time-consuming, are usually difficult to resist or control, and cause clinically significant distress or impairment in functioning. Physical defects that are clearly noticeable (i. e. , not slight) are not diagnosed as body dysmorphic disorder. However, skin picking as a symptom of body dysmo\u03c6hic disorder can cause noticeable skin lesions and scarring; in such cases, body dysmorphic disorder should be diagnosed. Eating disorders. In an individual with an eating disorder, concerns about being fat are considered a symptom of the eating disorder rather than body dysmorphic disorder. However, weight concerns may occur in body dysmorphic disorder. Eating disorders and body dysmorphic disorder can be comorbid, in which case both should be diagnosed. Other obsessive-compulsive and related disorders. The preoccupations and repetitive behaviors of body dysmorphic disorder differ from obsessions and compulsions in OCD in that the former focus only on appearance. These disorders have other differences, such as poorer insight in body dysmo\u03c6hic disorder. When skin picking is intended to improve the appearance of perceived skin defects, body dysmorphic disorder, rather than excoriation (skin-picking) disorder, is diagnosed. When hair removal (plucking, pulling, or other types of removal) is intended to improve perceived defects in the appearance of facial or body hair, body dysmo\u03c6hic disorder is diagnosed rather than trichotillomania (hairpulling disorder). Illness anxiety disorder. Individuals with body dysmorphic disorder are not preoccupied with having or acquiring a serious illness and do not have particularly elevated levels of somatization. Major depressive disorder. The prominent preoccupation with appearance and excessive repetitive behaviors in body dysmorphic disorder differentiate it from major depressive disorder. However, major depressive disorder and depressive symptoms are common in individuals with body dysmo\u03c6hic disorder, often appearing to be secondary to the distress and impairment that body dysmorphic disorder causes. Body dysmo\u03c6hic disorder should be diagnosed in depressed individuals if diagnostic criteria for body dysmo\u03c6hic disorder are met. Anxiety disorders. Social anxiety and avoidance are common in body dysmorphic disorder. However, unlike social anxiety disorder (social phobia), agoraphobia, and avoidant personality disorder, body dysmorphic disorder includes prominent appearance-related preoccupation, which may be delusional, and repetitive behaviors, and the social anxiety and avoidance are due to concerns about perceived appearance defects and the belief or fear that other people will consider these individuals ugly, ridicule them, or reject them because of their physical features. Unlike generalized anxiety disorder, anxiety and worry in body dysmo\u03c6hic disorder focus on perceived appearance flaws. Psychotic disorders. Many individuals with body dysmorphic disorder have delusional appearance beliefs (i. e. , complete conviction that their view of their perceived defects is accurate), which is diagnosed as body dysmo\u03c6hic disorder, with absent insight/ delusional beliefs, not as delusional disorder. Appearance-related ideas or delusions of reference are common in body dysmorphic disorder; however, unlike schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, body dysmo\u03c6hic disorder involves prominent appearance preoccupations and related repetitive behaviors, and disorganized behavior and other psychotic symptoms are absent (except for appearance beliefs, which may be delusional). Other disorders and symptoms. Body dysmorphic disorder should not be diagnosed if the preoccupation is limited to discomfort with or a desire to be rid of one's primary and/ or secondary sex characteristics in an individual with gender dysphoria or if the preoccupation focuses on the belief that one emits a foul or offensive body odor as in olfactory reference syndrome (which is not a DSM-5 disorder). Body identity integrity disorder (apotemnophilia) (which is not a DSM-5 disorder) involves a desire to have a limb amputated to correct ^n experience of mismatch between a person's sense of body identity and his or her actual anatomy. However, the concern does not focus on the limb's appearance, as it would in body dysmorphic disorder. Koro, a culturally related disorder that usually occurs in epidemics in Southeastern Asia, consists of a fear that the penis (labia, nipples, or breasts in females) is shrinking or retracting and will disappear into the abdomen, often accompanied by a belief that death will result. Koro differs from body dysmorphic disorder in several ways, including a focus on death rather than preoccupation with perceived ugliness. Dysmorphic concern (which is not a DSM-5 disorder) is a much broader construct than, and is not equivalent to, body dysmorphic disorder. It involves symptoms reflecting an overconcern with slight or imagined flaws in appearance. Comorbidity: Major depressive disorder is the most common comorbid disorder, with onset usually after that of body dysmorphic disorder. Comorbid social anxiety disorder (social phobia), OCD, and substance-related disorders are also common. Relationship To Other Classifications:.", "Disorder: Hoarding Disorder\nICD-9: 300. 3, ICD-10: F42\nNotes: \nDiagnostic Criteria:\n  A: Persistent difficulty discarding or parting with possessions, regardless of their actual value. B: This difficulty is due to a perceived need to save the items and to distress associated with discarding them\n  C: The difficulty discarding possessions results in the accumulation of possessions that congest and clutter active living areas and substantially compromises their intended use. If living areas are uncluttered, it is only because of the interventions of third parties (e. g. , family members, cleaners, authorities). D: The hoarding causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning (including maintaining a safe environment for self and others)\n  E: The hoarding is not attributable to another medical condition (e. g. , brain injury, cerebrovascular disease, Prader-Willi syndrome). F: The hoarding is not better explained by the symptoms of another mental disorder (e. g. , obsessions in obsessive-compulsive disorder, decreased energy in major depressive disorder, delusions in schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder, cognitive deficits in major neurocognitive disorder, restricted interests in autism spectrum disorder)\nDisorder Id: 64\nDiagnostic Features: The essential feature of hoarding disorder is persistent difficulties discarding or parting with possessions, regardless of their actual value (Criterion A). The term persistent indicates a long-standing difficulty rather than more transient life circumstances that may lead to excessive clutter, such as inheriting property. The difficulty in discarding possessions noted in Criterion A refers to any form of discarding, including throwing away, selling, giving away, or recycling. The main reasons given for these difficulties are the perceived utility or aesthetic value of the items or strong sentimental attachment to the possessions. Some individuals feel responsible for the fate of their possessions and often go to great lengths to avoid being wasteful. Fears of losing important information are also common. The most commonly saved items are newspapers, magazines, old clothing, bags, books, mail, and paperwork, but virtually any item can be saved. The nature of items is not limited to possessions that most other people would define as useless or of limited value. Many individuals collect and save large numbers of valuable things as well, which are often found in piles mixed with other less valuable items. Individuals with hoarding disorder purposefully save possessions and experience distress when facing the prospect of discarding them (Criterion B). This criterion emphasizes that the saving of possessions is intentional, which discriminates hoarding disorder from other forms of psychopathology that are characterized by the passive accumulation of items or the absence of distress when possessions are removed. Individuals accumulate large numbers of items that fill up and clutter active living areas to the extent that their intended use is no longer possible (Criterion C). For example, the individual may not be able to cook in the kitchen, sleep in his or her bed, or sit in a chair. If the space can be used, it is only with great difficulty. Clutter is defined as a large group of usually unrelated or marginally related objects piled together in a disorganized fashion in spaces designed for other purposes (e. g. , tabletops, floor, hallway). Criterion C emphasizes the ''active\" living areas of the home, rather than more peripheral areas, such as garages, attics, or basements, that are sometimes cluttered in homes of individuals without hoarding disorder. However, individuals with hoarding disorder often have possessions that spill beyond the active living areas and can occupy and impair the use of other spaces, such as vehicles, yards, the workplace, and friends' and relatives' houses. In some cases, living areas may be uncluttered because of the intervention of third parties (e. g. , family members, cleaners, local authorities). Individuals who have been forced to clear their homes still have a symptom picture that meets criteria for hoarding disorder because the lack of clutter is due to a third-party intervention. Hoarding disorder contrasts with normative collecting behavior, which is organized and systematic, even if in some cases the actual amount of possessions may be similar to the amount accumulated by an individual with hoarding disorder. Normative collecting does not produce the clutter, distress, or impairment typical of hoarding disorder. Symptoms (i. e. , difficulties discarding and/or clutter) must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning, including maintaining a safe environment for self and others (Criterion D). In some cases. particularly when there is poor insight, the individual may not report distress, and the impairment may apparent only to those around the individual. Hov^ever, any attempts to discard or clear the possessions by third parties result in high levels of distress. Recording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis: Other common features of hoarding disorder include indecisiveness, perfectionism, avoidance, procrastination, difficulty planning and organizing tasks, and distractibility. Some individuals with hoarding disorder live in unsanitary conditions that may be a logical consequence of severely cluttered spaces and/or that are related to planning and organizing difficulties. Animal hoarding can be defined as the accumulation of a large number of animals and a failure to provide minimal standards of nutrition, sanitation, and veterinary care and to act on the deteriorating condition of the animals (including disease, starvation, or death) and the environment (e. g. , severe overcrowding, extremely unsanitary conditions). Animal hoarding may be a special manifestation of hoarding disorder. Most individuals who hoard animals also hoard inanimate objects. The most prominent differences between animal and object hoarding are the extent of unsanitary conditions and the poorer insight in animal hoarding\nPrevalence: Nationally representative prevalence studies of hoarding disorder are not available. Community surveys estimate the point prevalence of clinically significant hoarding in the United States and Europe to be approximately 2%-6%. Hoarding disorder affects both males and females, but some epidemiological studies have reported a significantly greater prevalence among males. This contrasts with clinical samples, which are predominantly female. Hoarding symptoms appear to be almost three times more prevalent in older adults (ages 55-94 years) compared with younger adults (ages 34-44 years)\nDevelopment And Course: Hoarding appears to begin early in life and spans well into the late stages. Hoarding symptoms may first emerge around ages 11-15 years, start interfering with the individual's everyday functioning by the mid-20s, and cause clinically significant impairment by the mid-30s. Participants in clinical research studies are usually in their 50s. Thus, the severity of hoarding increases with each decade of life. Once symptoms begin, the course of hoarding is often chronic, with few individuals reporting a waxing and waning course. Pathological hoarding in children appears to be easily distinguished from developmentally adaptive saving and collecting behaviors. Because children and adolescents typically do not control their living environment and discarding behaviors, the possible intervention of third parties (e. g. , parents keeping the spaces usable and thus reducing interference) should be considered when making the diagnosis. Risk And Prognostic Factors: Temperamental. Indecisiveness is a prominent feature of individuals with hoarding disorder and their first-degree relatives. Environmental. Individuals with hoarding disorder often retrospectively report stressful and traumatic life events preceding the onset of the disorder or causing an exacerbation. Genetic and physiological. Hoarding behavior is familial, with about 50% of individuals who hoard reporting having a relative who also hoards. Twin studies indicate that approximately 50% of the variability in hoarding behavior is attributable to additive genetic factors. Culture Related Diagnostic Issues: While most of the research has been done in Western, industrialized countries and urban communities, the available data from non-Western and developing countries suggest that hoarding is a universal phenomenon with consistent clinical features. Gender Related Diagnostic Issues: The key features of hoarding disorder (i. e. , difficulties discarding, excessive amount of clutter) are generally comparable in males and females, but females tend to display more excessive acquisition, particularly excessive buying, than do males\nSuicide Risk:  \nFunctional Consequences: Clutter impairs basic activities, such as moving through the house, cooking, cleaning, personal hygiene, and even sleeping. Appliances may be broken, and utilities such as water and electricity may be disconnected, as access for repair work may be difficult. Quality of life is often considerably impaired. In severe cases, hoarding can put individuals at risk for fire, falling (especially elderly individuals), poor sanitation, and other health risks. Hoarding disorder is associated with occupational impairment, poor physical health, and high social service utilization. Family relationships are frequently under great strain. Conflict with neighbors and local authorities is common, and a substantial proportion of individuals with severe hoarding disorder have been involved in legal eviction proceedings, and some have a history of eviction\nDiagnostic Markers:  \nDifferential Diagnosis: Other medical conditions. Hoarding disorder is not diagnosed if the symptoms are judged to be a direct consequence of another medical condition (Criterion E), such as traumatic brain injury, surgical resection for treatment of a tumor or seizure control, cerebrovascular disease, infections of the central nervous system (e. g. , herpes simplex encephalitis), or neurogenetic conditions such as Prader-Willi syndrome. Damage to the anterior ventromedial prefrontal and cingulate cortices has been particularly associated with the excessive accumulation of objects. In these individuals, the hoarding behavior is not present prior to the onset of the brain damage and appears shortly after the brain damage occurs. Some of these individuals appear to have little interest in the accumulated items and are able to discard them easily or do not care if others discard them, whereas others appear to be very reluctant to discard anything. Neurodevelopmental disorders. Hoarding disorder is not diagnosed if the accumulation of objects is judged to be a direct consequence of a neurodevelopmental disorder, such as autism spectrum disorder or intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder). Schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders. Hoarding disorder is not diagnosed if the accumulation of objects is judged to be a direct consequence of delusions or negative symptoms in schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders. Major depressive episode. Hoarding disorder is not diagnosed if the accumulation of objects is judged to be a direct consequence of psychomotor retardation, fatigue, or loss of energy during a major depressive episode. Obsessive-compulsive disorder. Hoarding disorder is not diagnosed if the symptoms are judged to be a direct consequence of typical obsessions or compulsions, such as fears of contamination, harm, or feelings of incompleteness in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Feelings of incompleteness (e. g. , losing one's identity, or having to document and preserve all life experiences) are the most frequent OCD symptoms associated with this form of hoarding. The accumulation of objects can also be the result of persistently avoid\u00ad ing onerous rituals (e. g. , not discarding objects in order to avoid endless washing or checking rituals). In OCD, the behavior is generally unwanted and highly distressing, and the individual experiences no pleasure or reward from it. Excessive acquisition is usually not present; if excessive acquisition is present, items are acquired because of a specific obsession (e. g. , the need to buy items that have been accidentally touched in order to avoid contaminating other people), not because of a genuine desire to possess the items. Individuals who hoard in the context of OCD are also more likely to accumulate bizarre items, such as trash, feces, urine, nails, hair, used diapers, or rotten food. Accumulation of such items is very unusual in hoarding disorder. When severe hoarding appears concurrently with other typical symptoms of OCD but is judged to be independent from these symptoms, both hoarding disorder and OCD may be diagnosed. Neurocognitive disorders. Hoarding disorder is not diagnosed if the accumulation of objects is judged to be a direct consequence of a degenerative disorder, such as neurocognitive disorder associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration or Alzheimer's disease. Typically, onset of the accumulating behavior is gradual and follows onset of the neurocognitive disorder. The accumulating behavior may be accompanied by self-neglect and severe domestic squalor, alongside other neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as disinhibition, gambling, rituals/stereotypies, tics, and self-injurious behaviors. Comorbidity: Approximately 75% of individuals with hoarding disorder have a comorbid mood or anxiety disorder. The most common comorbid conditions are major depressive disorder (up to 50% of cases), social anxiety disorder (social phobia), and generalized anxiety disorder. Approximately 20% of individuals with hoarding disorder also have symptoms that meet diagnostic criteria for OCD. These comorbidities may often be the main reason for consultation, because individuals are unlikely to spontaneously report hoarding symptoms, and these symptoms are often not asked about in routine clinical interviews. Relationship To Other Classifications:.", "Disorder: Trichotillomania (Hair-Pulling Disorder)\nICD-9: 312. 39, ICD-10: F63. 2\nNotes: \nDiagnostic Criteria:\n  A: Recurrent pulling out of one\u2019s hair, resulting in hair loss. B: Repeated attempts to decrease or stop hair pulling\n  C: The hair pulling causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning\n  D: The hair pulling or hair loss is not attributable to another medical condition (e. g. , a dermatological condition). E: The hair pulling is not better explained by the symptoms of another mental disorder (e. g. , attempts to improve a perceived defect or flaw in appearance in body dysmorphic disorder). Disorder Id: 65\nDiagnostic Features: The essential feature of trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder) is the recurrent pulling out of one's own hair (Criterion A). Hair pulling may occur from any region of the body in which hair grows; the most common sites are the scalp, eyebrows, and eyelids, while less common sites are axillary, facial, pubic, and peri-rectal regions. Hair-pulling sites may vary over time. Hair pulling may occur in brief episodes scattered throughout the day or during less frequent but more sustained periods that can continue for hours, and such hair pulling may endure for months or years. Criterion A requires that hair pulling lead to hair loss, although individuals with this disorder may pull hair in a widely distributed pattern (i. e. , pulling single hairs from all over a site) such that hair loss may not be clearly visible. Alternatively, individuals may attempt to conceal or camouflage hair loss (e. g. , by using makeup, scarves, or wigs). Individuals with trichotillomania have made repeated attempts to decrease or stop hair pulling (Criterion B). Criterion C indicates that hair pulling causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The term distress includes negative affects that may be experienced by individuals with hair pulling, such as feeling a loss of control, embarrassment, and shame. Significant impairment may occur in several different areas of functioning (e. g. , social, occupational, academic, and leisure), in part because of avoidance of work, school, or other public situations\nRecording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis: Hair pulling may be accompanied by a range of behaviors or rituals involving hair. Thus, individuals may search for a particular kind of hair to pull (e. g. , hairs with a specific texture or color), may try to pull out hair in a specific way (e. g. , so that the root comes out intact), or may visually examine or tactilely or orally manipulate the hair after it has been pulled (e. g. , rolling the hair between the fingers, pulling the strand between the teeth, biting the hair into pieces, or swallowing the hair). Hair pulling may also be preceded or accompanied by various emotional states; it may be triggered by feelings of anxiety or boredom, may be preceded by an increasing sense of tension (either immediately before pulling out the hair or when attempting to resist the urge to pull), or may lead to gratification, pleasure, or a sense of relief when the hair is pulled out. Hair-pulling behavior may involve varying degrees of conscious awareness, with some individuals displaying more focused attention on the hair pulling (with preceding tension and subsequent relief), and other individuals displaying more automatic behavior (in which the hair pulling seems to occur without full awareness). Many individuals report a mix of both behavioral styles. Some individuals experience an \"itch-like\" or tingling sensation in the scalp that is alleviated by the act of pulling hair. Pain does not usually accompany hair pulling. Patterns of hair loss are highly variable. Areas of complete alopecia, as well as areas of thinned hair density, are common. When the scalp is involved, there may be a predilection for pulling out hair in the crown or parietal regions. There may be a pattern of nearly complete baldness except for a narrow perimeter around the outer margins of the scalp, particularly at the nape of the neck (\"tonsure trichotillomania\"). Eyebrows and eyelashes may be completely absent. Hair pulling does not usually occur in the presence of other individuals, except immediate family members. Some individuals have urges to pull hair from other individuals and may sometimes try to find opportunities to do so surreptitiously. Some individuals may pull hairs from pets, dolls, and other fibrous materials (e. g. , sweaters or carpets). Some individuals may deny their hair pulling to others. The majority of individuals with trichotillomania also have one or more other body-focused repetitive behaviors, including skin picking, nail biting, and lip chewing. Prevalence: In the general population, the 12-month prevalence estimate for trichotillomania in adults and adolescents is l%-2%. Females are more frequently affected than males, at a ratio of approximately 10:1. This estimate likely reflects the true gender ratio of the condition, although it may also reflect differential treatment seeking based on gender or cultural attitudes regarding appearance (e. g. , acceptance of normative hair loss among males). Among children with trichotillomania, males and females are more equally represented. Development And Course: Hair pulling ma\u00ff be seen in infants, and this behavior typically resolves during early development. Onset of hair pulling in trichotillomania most commonly coincides with, or follows the onset of, puberty. Sites of hair pulling may vary over time. The usual course of trichotillomania is chronic, with some waxing and waning if the disorder is untreated. Symptoms may possibly worsen in females accompanying hormonal changes (e. g. , menstruation, perimenopause). For some individuals, the disorder may come and go for weeks, months, or years at a time. A minority of individuals remit without subsequent relapse within a few years of onset. Risk And Prognostic Factors: Genetic and physiological. There is evidence for a genetic vulnerability to trichotillomania. The disorder is more common in individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and their first-degree relatives than in the general population\nCulture Related Diagnostic Issues: Trichotillomania appears to manifest similarly across cultures, although there is a paucity of data from non-Westem regions. Gender Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nSuicide Risk:  \nFunctional Consequences: Trichotillomania is associated with distress as well as with social and occupational impairment. There may be irreversible damage to hair growth and hair quality. Infrequent medical consequences of trichotillomania include digit purpura, musculoskeletal injury (e. g. , carpal tunnel syndrome; back, shoulder and neck pain), blepharitis, and dental damage (e. g. , worn or broken teeth due to hair biting). Swallowing of hair (trichophagia) may lead to trichobezoars, with subsequent anemia, abdominal pain, hematemesis, nausea and vomiting, bowel obstruction, and even perforation. Diagnostic Markers: Most individuals with trichotillomania admit to hair pulling; thus, dermatopathological diagnosis is rarely required. Skin biopsy and dermoscopy (or trichoscopy) of trichotillomania are able to differentiate the disorder from other causes of alopecia. In trichotillomania, dermoscopy shows a range of characteristic features, including decreased hair density, short vellus hair, and broken hairs with different shaft lengths. Differential Diagnosis: Normative hair removal/manipulation. Trichotillomania should not be diagnosed when hair removal is performed solely for cosmetic reasons (i. e. , to improve one's physical appearance). Many individuals twist and play with their hair, but this behavior does not usually qualify for a diagnosis of trichotillomania. Some individuals may bite rather than pull hair; again, this does not qualify for a diagnosis of trichotillomania. Other obsessive-compulsive and related disorders. Individuals with OCD and symmetry concerns may pull out hairs as part of their symmetry rituals, and individuals with body dysmorphic disorder may remove body hair that they perceive as ugly, asymmetrical, or abnormal; in such cases a diagnosis of trichotillomania is not given. The description of body-focused repetitive behavior disorder in other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder excludes individuals who meet diagnostic criteria for trichotillomania. Neurodevelopmental disorders. In neurodevelopmental disorders, hair pulling may meet the definition of stereotypies (e. g. , in stereotypic movement disorder). Tics (in tic disorders) rarely lead to hair pulling. Psychotic disorder. Individuals with a psychotic disorder may remove hair in response to a delusion or hallucination. Trichotillomania is not diagnosed in such cases. Another medical condition. Trichotillomania is not diagnosed if the hair pulling or hair loss is attributable to another medical condition (e. g. , inflammation of the skin or other dermatological conditions). Other causes of scarring alopecia (e. g. , alopecia areata, androgenic alopecia, telogen effluvium) or nonscarring alopecia (e. g. , chronic discoid lupus erythematosus, lichen planopilaris, central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia, pseudopelade, folliculitis decalvans, dissecting foUiculitis, acne keloidalis nuchae) should be considered in individuals with hair loss who deny hair pulling. Skin biopsy or dermoscopy can be used to differentiate individuals with trichotillomania from those with dermatological disorders. Substance-related disorders. Hair-pulling symptoms may be exacerbated by certain substances\u2014for example, stimulants\u2014^but it is less likely that substances are the primary cause of persistent hair pulling. Comorbidity: Trichotillomania is often accompanied by other mental disorders, most commonly major depressive disorder and excoriation (skin-picking) disorder. Repetitive body-focused symptoms other than hair pulling or skin picking (e. g. nail biting) occur in the majority of individuals with trichotillomania and may deserve an additional diagnosis of other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder (i. e. , body-focused repetitive behavior disorder)\nRelationship To Other Classifications:.", "Disorder: Excoriation (Skin-Picking) Disorder\nICD-9: 698. 4, ICD-10: L98. 1\nNotes: \nDiagnostic Criteria:\n  A: Recurrent skin picking resulting in skin lesions\n  B: Repeated attempts to decrease or stop skin picking. C: The skin picking causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning\n  D: The skin picking is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e. g. , cocaine) or another medical condition (e. g. , scabies). E: The skin picking is not better explained by symptoms of another mental disorder (e. g. , delusions or tactile hallucinations in a psychotic disorder, attempts to improve a perceived defect or flaw in appearance in body dysmorphic disorder, stereotypies in stereotypic movement disorder, or intention to harm oneself in nonsuicidal self-injury)\nDisorder Id: 66\nDiagnostic Features: The essential feature of excoriation (skin-picking) disorder is recurrent picking at one's own skin (Criterion A). The most commonly picked sites are the face, arms, and hands, but many individuals pick from multiple body sites. Individuals may pick at healthy skin, at minor skin irregularities, at lesions such as pimples or calluses, or at scabs from previous picking. Most individuals pick with their fingernails, although many use tweezers, pins, or other objects. In addition to skin picking, there may be skin rubbing, squeezing, lancing, and biting. Individuals with excoriation disorder often spend significant amounts of time on their picking behavior, sometimes several hours per day, and such skin picking may endure for months or years. Criterion A requires that skin picking lead to skin lesions, although individu^als with this disorder often attempt to conceal or camouflage such lesions (e. g. , with makeup or clothing). Individuals with excoriation disorder have made repeated attempts to decrease or stop skin picking (Criterion B). Criterion C indicates that skin picking causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The term distress includes negative affects that may be experienced by individuals with skin picking, such as feeling a loss of control, embarrassment, and shame. Significant impairment may occur in several different areas of functioning (e. g. , social, occupational, academic, and leisure), in part because of avoidance of social situations\nRecording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis: Skin picking may be accompanied by a range of behaviors or rihials involving skin or scabs. Thus, individuals may search for a particular kind of scab to pull, and they may examine, play with, or mouth or swallow the skin after it has been pulled. Skin picking may also be preceded or accompanied by various emotional states. Skin picking may be triggered by feelings of anxiety or boredom, may be preceded by an increasing sense of tension (either immediately before picking the skin or when attempting to resist the urge to pick), and may lead to gratification, pleasure, or a sense of relief when the skin or scab has been picked. Some individuals report picking in response to a minor skin irregularity or to relieve an uncomfortable bodily sensation. Pain is not routinely reported to accompany skin picking. Some individuals engage in skin picking that is more focused (i. e. , with preceding tension and subsequent relief), whereas others engage in more automatic picking (i. e. , when skin picking occurs without preceding tension and without full awareness), and many have a mix of both behavioral styles. Skin picking does not usually occur in the presence of other individuals, except immediate faniily members. Some individuals report picking the skin of others. Prevalence: In the general population, the lifetime prevalence for excoriation disorder in adults is 1. 4% or somewhat higher. Three-quarters or more of individuals with the disorder are female. This likely reflects the true gender ratio of the condition, although it may also reflect differential treatment seeking based on gender or cultural attitudes regarding appearance. Development And Course: Although individuals with excoriation disorder may present at various ages, the skin picking most often has onset during adolescence, commonly coinciding with or following the onset of puberty. The disorder frequently begins with a dermatological condition, such as acne. Sites of skin picking may vary over time. The usual course is chronic, with some waxing and waning if untreated. For some individuals, the disorder may come and go for weeks, months, or years at a time. Risk And Prognostic Factors: Genetic and physiological. Excoriation disorder is more common in individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and their first-degree family members than in the general population\nCulture Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nGender Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nSuicide Risk:  \nFunctional Consequences: Excoriation disorder is associated with distress as well as with social and occupational impairment. The majority of individuals with this condition spend at least 1 hour per day picking, thinking about picking, and resisting urges to pick. Many individuals report avoiding social or entertainment events as well as going out in public. A majority of individuals with the disorder also report experiencing work interference from skin picking on at least a daily or weekly basis. A significant proportion of students with excoriation disorder report having missed school, having experienced difficulties managing responsibilities at school, or having had difficulties studying because of skin picking. Medical complications of skin picking include tissue damage, scarring, and infection and can be life-threatening. Rarely, synovitis of the wrists due to chronic picking has been reported. Skin picking often results in significant tissue damage and scarring. It frequently requires antibiotic treatment for infection, and on occasion it may require surgery. Diagnostic Markers: Most individuals with excoriation disorder admit to skin picking; therefore, dermatopathological diagnosis is rarely required. However, the disorder may have characteristic features on histopathology\nDifferential Diagnosis: Psychotic disorder. Skin picking may occur in response to a delusion (i. e. , parasitosis) or tactile hallucination (i. e. , formication) in a psychotic disorder. In such cases, excoriation disorder should not be diagnosed. Other obsessive-compulsive and related disorders. Excessive washing compulsions in response to contamination obsessions in individuals with OCD may lead to skin lesions, and skin picking may occur in individuals with body dysmorphic disorder who pick their skin solely because of appearance concerns; in such cases, excoriation disorder should not be diagnosed. The description of body-focused repetitive behavior disorder in other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder excludes individuals whose symptoms meet diagnostic criteria for excoriation disorder. Neurodevelopmental disorders. While stereotypic movement disorder may be characterized by repetitive self-injurious behavior, onset is in the early developmental period. For example, individuals with the neurogenetic condition Prader-Willi syndrome may have early onset of skin picking, and their symptoms may meet criteria for stereotypic movement disorder. While tics in individuals with Tourette's disorder may lead to selfinjury, the behavior is not tic-like in excoriation disorder. Somatic symptom and related disorders. Excoriation disorder is not diagnosed if the skin lesion is primarily attributable to deceptive behaviors in factitious disorder. Other disorders. Excoriation disorder is not diagnosed if the skin picking is primarily attributable to the intention to harm oneself that is characteristic of nonsuicidal self-injury. Other medical conditions. Excoriation disorder is not diagnosed if the skin picking is primarily attributable to another medical condition. For example, scabies is a dermatological condition invariably associated with severe itching and scratching. However, excoriation disorder may be precipitated or exacerbated by an underlying dermatological condition. For example, acne may lead to some scratching and picking, which may also be associated with comorbid excoriation disorder. The differentiation between these two clir\u00fccal situations (acne with some scratching and picking vs. acne with comorbid excoriation disorder) requires an assessment of the extent to which the individual's skin picking has become independent of the underlying dermatological condition. Substance/medication-induced disorders. Skin-picking symptoms may also be induced by certain substances (e. g. , cocaine), in which case excoriation disorder should not be diagnosed. If such skin picking is clinically significant, then a diagnosis of substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder should be considered. Comorbidity: Excoriation disorder is often accompanied by other mental disorders. Such disorders include OCD and trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder), as well as major depressive disorder. Repetitive body-focused symptoms other than skin picking and hair pulling (e. g. , nail biting) occur in many individuals with excoriation disorder and may deserve an additional diagnosis of other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder (i. e. , body-focused repetitive behavior disorder). Relationship To Other Classifications:.", "Disorder: Substance/Medication-Induced Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorder\nICD-9: Variable, ICD-10: Variable\nNotes: \nDiagnostic Criteria:\n  A: Obsessions, compulsions, skin picking, hair pulling, other body-focused repetitive behaviors, or other symptoms characteristic of the obsessive-compulsive and related disorders predominate in the clinical picture\n  B: There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings of both (1)and (2):\n  C: The disturbance is not better explained by an obsessive-compulsive and related disorder that is not substance/medication-induced. Such evidence of an independent obsessive-compulsive and related disorder could include the following: The symptoms precede the onset of the substance/medication use; the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time (e. g. , about 1 month) after the cessation of acute withdrawal or severe intoxication; or there is other evidence suggesting the existence of an independent non-substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder (e. g. , a history of recurrent non-substance/medicationrelated episodes)\n  D: The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium\n  E: The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning\nDisorder Id: 67\nDiagnostic Features: The essential features of substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder are prominent symptoms of an obsessive-compulsive and related disorder (Criterion A) that are judged to be attributable to the effects of a substance (e. g. , drug of abuse, medication). The obsessive-compulsive and related disorder symptoms must have developed during or soon after substance intoxication or withdrawal or after exposure to a medication or toxin, and the substance/medication must be capable of producing the symptoms (Criterion B). Substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to a prescribed treatment for a mental disorder or general medical condition must have its onset while the individual is receiving the medication. Once the treatment is discontinued, the obsessive-compulsive and related disorder symptoms will usually improve or remit within days to several weeks to 1 month (depending on the half-life of the substance/medication). The diagnosis of substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder should not be given if onset of the obsessive-compulsive and related disorder symptoms precedes the substance intoxication or medication use, or if the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time, usually longer than 1 month, from the time of severe intoxication or withdrawal. If the obsessive-compulsive and related disorder symptoms persist for a substantial period of time, other causes for the symptoms should be considered. The substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder diagnosis should be made in addition to a diagnosis of substance intoxication only when the symptoms in Criterion A predominate in the clinical picture and are sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention\nRecording Procedures: ICD-9-CM. The name of the substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder begins with the specific substance (e. g. , cocaine) that is presumed to be causing the obsessive-compulsive and related symptoms. The diagnostic code is selected from the table included in the criteria set, which is based on the drug class. For substances that do not fit into any of the classes, the code for \"other substance\" should be used; and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of substance is unknown, the category \"unknown substance\" should be used. The name of the disorder is followed by the specification of onset (i. e. , onset during intoxication, onset during withdrawal, with onset after medication use). Unlike the recording procedures for ICD-IO-CM, which combine the substance-induced disorder and substance use disorder into a single code, for ICD-9-CM a separate diagnostic code is given for the substance use disorder. For example, in the case of repetitive behaviors occurring during intoxication in a man with a severe cocaine use disorder, the diagnosis is 292. 89 cocaine-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder, with onset during intoxication. An additional diagnosis of 304. 20 severe cocaine use disorder is also given. When more than one substance is judged to play a significant role in the development of the obsessive-compulsive and related disorder, each should be listed separately. ICD-10-CM. The name of the substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder begins with the specific substance (e. g. , cocaine) that is presumed to be causing the obsessive-compulsive and related symptoms. The diagnostic code is selected from the table included in the criteria set, which is based on the drug class and presence or absence of a comorbid substance use disorder. For substances that do not fit into any of the classes, the code for \"other substance\" with no comorbid substance use should be used; and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of substance is unknown, the category \"unknown substance\" with no comorbid substance use should be used. When recording the name of the disorder, the comorbid substance use disorder (if any) is listed first, followed by the word \"with,\" followed by the name of the substance-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder, followed by the specification of onset (i. e. , onset during intoxication, onset during withdrawal, with onset after medication use). For example, in the case of repetitive behaviors occurring during intoxication in a man with a severe cocaine use disorder, the diagnosis is F14. 288 severe cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder, with onset during intoxication. A separate diagnosis of the comorbid severe cocaine use disorder is not given. If the substance-induced obsessivecompulsive and related disorder occurs without a comorbid substance use disorder (e. g. , after a one-time heavy use of the substance), no accompanying substance use disorder is noted (e. g. , F15. 988 amphetamine-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder, with onset during intoxication). When more than one substance is judged to play a significant role in the development of the obsessive-compulsive and related disorder, each should be listed separately\nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis: Obsessions, compulsions, hair pulling, skin picking, or other body-focused repetitive behaviors can occur in association with intoxication with the following classes of substances: stimulants (including cocaine) and other (or unknown) substances. Heavy metals and toxins may also cause obsessive-compulsive and related disorder symptoms. Laboratory assessments (e. g. , urine toxicology) may be useful to measure substance intoxication as part of an assessment for obsessive-compulsive and related disorders. Prevalence: In the general population, the very limited data that are available indicate that substanceinduced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder is very rare. Development And Course:  \nRisk And Prognostic Factors:  \nCulture Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nGender Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nSuicide Risk:  \nFunctional Consequences:  \nDiagnostic Markers:  \nDifferential Diagnosis: Substance intoxication. Obsessive-compulsive and related disorder symptoms may occur in substance intoxication. The diagnosis of the substance-specific intoxication will usu\u00ad ally suffice to categorize the symptom presentation. A diagnosis of an obsessive-compulsive and related disorder should be made in addition to substance intoxication when the symptoms are judged to be in excess of those usually associated with intoxication and are sufficiently severe to warrant independent clinical attention. Obsessive-compulsive and related disorder (i. e. , not induced by a substance). Substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder is judged to be etiologically related to the substance/medication. Substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder is distinguished from a primary obsessive-compulsive and related disorder by considering the onset, course, and other factors with respect to substances/medications. For drugs of abuse, there must be evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings for use or intoxication. Substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder arises only in association with intoxication, whereas a primary obsessive-compulsive and related disorder may precede the onset of substance/medication use. The presence of features that are atypical of a primary obsessive-compulsive and related disorder, such as atypical age at onset of symptoms, may suggest a substance-induced etiology. A primary obsessive-compulsive and related disorder diagnosis is warranted if the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time (about 1 month or longer) after the end of the substance intoxication or the individual has a history of an obsessive-compulsive and related disorder. Obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to another medical condition. If the obsessive-compulsive and related disorder symptoms are attributable to another medical condition (i. e. , rather than to the medication taken for the other medical condition), obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to another medical condition should be diagnosed. The history often provides the basis for judgment. At times, a change in the treatment for the other medical condition (e. g. , medication substitution or discontinuation) may be needed to determine whether or not the medication is the causative agent (in which case the symptoms may be better explained by substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder). If the disturbance is attributable to both another medical condition and substance use, both diagnoses (i. e. , obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to another medical condition and substance/medication-induced obsessivecompulsive and related disorder) may be given. When there is insufficient evidence to determine whether the symptoms are attributable to either a substance/medication or another medical condition or are primary (i. e. , attributable to neither a substance/medication nor another medical condition), a diagnosis of other specified or unspecified obsessivecompulsive and related disorder would be indicated. Delirium. If obsessive-compulsive and related disorder symptoms occur exclusively during the course of delirium, they are considered to be an associated feature of the delirium and are not diagnosed separately.

D: The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium\n  E: The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning\nDisorder Id: 68\nDiagnostic Features: The essential feature of obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to another medical condition is clinically significant obsessive-compulsive and related symptoms that are judged to be best explained as the direct pathophysiological consequence of another medical condition. Symptoms can include prominent obsessions, compulsions, preoccupations with appearance, hoarding, hair pulling, skin picking, or other body-focused repetitive behaviors (Criterion A). The judgment that the symptoms are best explained by the associated medical condition must be based on evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings (Criterion B). Additionally, it must be judged that the symptoms are not better explained by another mental disorder (Criterion C). The diagnosis is not made if the obsessive-compulsive and related symptoms occur only during the course of a delirium (Criterion D). The obsessive-compulsive and related symptoms must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning (Criterion E). In determining whether the obsessive-compulsive and related symptoms are attributable to another medical condition, a relevant medical condition must be present. Furthermore, it must be established that obsessive-compulsive and related symptoms can be etiologically related to the medical condition through a pathophysiological mechanism and that this best explains the symptoms in the individual. Although there are no infallible guidelines for determining whether the relationship between the obsessive-compulsive and related symptoms and the medical condition is etiological, considerations that may provide some guidance in making this diagnosis include the presence of a clear temporal association between the onset, exacerbation, or remission of the medical condition and the obsessive-compulsive and related symptoms; the presence of features that are atypical of a primary obsessive-compulsive and related disorder (e. g. , atypical age at onset or course); and evidence in the literature that a known physiological mechanism (e. g. , striatal damage) causes obsessive-compulsive and related symptoms. In addition, the disturbance cannot be better explained by a primary obsessive-compulsive and related disorder, a substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder, or another mental disorder. There is some controversy about whether obsessive-compulsive and related disorders can be attributed to Group A streptococcal infection. Sydenham's chorea is the neurolog\u00ad ical manifestation of rheumatic fever, which is in turn due to Group A streptococcal infection. Sydenham's chorea is characterized by a combination of motor and nonmotor features. Nonmotor features include obsessions, compulsions, attention deficit, and emotional lability. Although individuals w^ith Sydenham's chorea may present with nonneuropsychiatric features of acute rheumatic fever, such as carditis and arthritis, they may present with obsessive-compulsive disorder-like symptoms; such individuals should be diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to another medical condition. Pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections (PANDAS) has been identified as another post-infectious autoimmune disorder characterized by the sudden onset of obsessions, compulsions, and/or tics accompanied by a variety of acute neuropsychiatric symptoms in the absence of chorea, carditis, or arthritis, after Group A streptococcal infection. Although there is a body of evidence that supports the existence of PANDAS, it remains a controversial diagnosis. Given this ongoing controversy, the description of PANDAS has been modified to eliminate etiological factors and to designate an expanded clinical entity: pediatric acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome (PANS) or idiopathic childhood acute neuropsychiatric symptoms (CANS), which deserves further study. Recording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis: A number of other medical disorders are known to include obsessive-compulsive and related symptoms as a manifestation. Examples include disorders leading to striatal damage, such as cerebral infarction\nPrevalence:  \nDevelopment And Course: The development and course of obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to another medical condition generally follows the course of the underlying illness.

A separate diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to another medical condition is not given if the disturbance occurs exclusively during the course of a delirium. However, a diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to another medical condition may be given in addition to a diagnosis of major neurocognitive disorder (dementia) if the etiology of the obsessive-compulsive symptoms is judged to be a physiological consequence of the pathological process causing the dementia and if obsessive-compulsive symptoms are a prominent part of the clinical presentation. Mixed presentation of symptoms (e. g. , mood and obsessive-compulsive and related disorder symptoms). If the presentation includes a mix of different types of symptoms, the specific mental disorder due to another medical condition depends on which symptoms predominate in the clinical picture. Substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorders. If there is evidence of recent or prolonged substance use (including medications with psychoactive effects), withdrawal from a substance, or exposure to a toxin, a substance/medicationinduced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder should be considered. When a substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder is being diagnosed in relation to drugs of abuse, it may be useful to obtain a urine or blood drug screen or other appropriate laboratory evaluation. Symptoms that occur during or shortly after (i. e. , within 4 v^eeks of) substance intoxication or withdrawal or after medication use may be especially indicative of a substance/medication-induced obsessive-compulsive and related disorder, depending on the type, duration, or amount of the substance used. Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders (primary). Obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to another medical condition should be distinguished from a primary obsessive-compulsive and related disorder. In primary mental disorders, no specific and direct causative physiological mechanisms associated with a medical condition can be demonstrated. Late age at onset or atypical symptoms suggest the need for a thorough assessment to rule out the diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive and related disorder due to another medical condition. Illness anxiety disorder. Illness anxiety disorder is characterized by a preoccupation with having or acquiring a serious illness. In the case of illness anxiety disorder, individuals may or may not have diagnosed medical conditions. Associated feature of another mental disorder. Obsessive-compulsive and related symptoms may be an associated feature of another mental disorder (e. g. , schizophrenia, anorexia nervosa). Other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder or unspecified obsessivecompulsive and related disorder. These diagnoses are given if it is unclear whether the obsessive-compulsive and related symptoms are primary, substance-induced, or due to another medical condition.

The other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific obsessive-compulsive and related disorder. This is done by recording \u201cother specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder\u201d followed by the specific reason (e. g. , \u201cbody-focused repetitive behavior disorder\u201d).

G: The child has a developmental age of at least 9 months\nDisorder Id: 71\nDiagnostic Features: Reactive attachment disorder of infancy or early childhood is characterized by a pattern of markedly disturbed and developmentally inappropriate attachment behaviors, in which a child rarely or minimally turns preferentially to an attachment figure for comfort, support, protection, and nurturance. The essential feature is absent or grossly underdeveloped attachment between the child and putative caregiving adults. Children with reactive attachment disorder are believed to have the capacity to form selective attachments. However, because of limited opportunities during early development, they fail to show the behavioral manifestations of selective attachments. That is, when distressed, they show no consistent effort to obtain comfort, support, nurturance, or protection from caregivers. Furthermore, when distressed, children with this disorder do not respond more than minimally to comforting efforts of caregivers. Thus, the disorder is associated with the absence of expected comfort seeking and response to comforting behaviors. As such, children with reactive attachment disorder show diminished or absent expression of positive emotions during routine interactions with caregivers. In addition, their emotion regulation capacity is compromised, and they display episodes of negative emotions of fear, sadness, or irritability that are not readily explained. A diagnosis of reactive attachment disorder should not be made in children who are developmentally unable to form selective attachments. For this reason, the child must have a developmental age of at least 9 months. Recording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis: Because of the shared etiological association with social neglect, reactive attachment disorder often co-occurs with developmental delays, especially in delays in cognition and language. Other associated features include stereotypies and other signs of severe neglect (e. g. , malnutrition or signs of poor care)\nPrevalence: The prevalence of reactive attachment disorder is unknown, but the disorder is seen relatively rarely in clinical settings. The disorder has been found in young children exposed to severe neglect before being placed in foster care or raised in institutions. However, even in populations of severely neglected children, the disorder is uncommon, occurring in less than 10% of such children. Development And Course: Conditions of sotial neglect are often present in the first months of life in children diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, even before the disorder is diagnosed. The clinical features of the disorder manifest in a similar fashion between the ages of 9 months and 5 years. That is, signs of absent-to-minimal attachment behaviors and associated emotionally aberrant behaviors are evident in children throughout this age range, although differing cognitive and motor abilities may affect how these behaviors are expressed. Without remediation and recovery through normative caregiving environments, it appears that signs of the disorder may persist, at least for several years. It is unclear whether reactive attachment disorder occurs in older children and, if so, how it differs from its presentation in young children. Because of this, the diagnosis should be made with caution in children older than 5 years. Risk And Prognostic Factors: Environmental. Serious social neglect is a diagnostic requirement for reactive attachment disorder and is also the only known risk factor for the disorder. However, the majority of severely neglected children do not develop the disorder. Prognosis appears to depend on the quality of the caregiving environment following serious neglect. Culture Related Diagnostic Issues: Similar attachment behaviors have been described in young children in many different cultures around the world. However, caution should be exercised in making the diagnosis of reactive attachment disorder in cultures in which attachment has not been studied. Gender Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nSuicide Risk:  \nFunctional Consequences: Reactive attachment disorder significantly impairs young children's abilities to relate inte\u03c6ersonally to adults or peers and is associated with functional impairment across many domains of early childhood. Diagnostic Markers:  \nDifferential Diagnosis: Autism spectrum disorder. Aberrant social behaviors manifest in young children with reactive attachment disorder, but they also are key features of autism spectrum disorder. Specifically, young children with either condition can manifest dampened expression of positive emotions, cognitive and language delays, and impairments in social reciprocity. As a result, reactive attachment disorder must be differentiated from autism spectrum disorder. These two disorders can be distinguished based on differential histories of neglect and on the presence of restricted interests or ritualized behaviors, specific deficit in social communication, and selective attachment behaviors. Children with reactive attachment disorder have experienced a history of severe social neglect, although it is not always possible to obtain detailed histories about the precise nature of their experiences, especially in initial evaluations. Children with autistic spectrum disorder will only rarely have a history of social neglect. The restricted interests and repetitive behaviors characteristic of autism spectrum disorder are not a feature of reactive attachment disorder. These clinical features manifest as excessive adherence to rituals and routines; restricted, fixated interests; and unusual sensory reactions. However, it is important to note that children with either condition can exhibit stereotypic behaviors such as rocking or flapping. Children with either disorder also may exhibit a range of intellectual functioning, but only children with autis- tic spectrum disorder exhibit selective impairments in social communicative behaviors, such as intentional communication (i. e. , impairment in communication that is deliberate, goal-directed, and aimed at influencing the behavior of the recipient). Children with reactive attachment disorder show social communicative functioning comparable to their overall level of intellectual functioning. Finally, children with autistic spectrum disorder regularly show attachment behavior typical for their developmental level. In contrast, children with reactive attachment disorder do so only rarely or inconsistently, if at all. Intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder). Developmental delays often accompany reactive attachment disorder, but they should not be confused with the disorder. Children with intellectual disability should exhibit social and emotional skills comparable to their cognitive skills and do not demonstrate the profound reduction in positive affect and emotion regulation difficulties evident in children with reactive attachment disorder. In addition, developmentally delayed children who have reached a cognitive age of 7-9 months should demonstrate selective attachments regardless of their chronological age. In contrast, children with reactive attachment disorder show lack of preferred attachment despite having attained a developmental age of at least 9 months. Depressive disorders. Depression in young children is also associated with reductions in positive affect. There is limited evidence, however, to suggest that children with depressive disorders have impairments in attachment. That is, young children who have been diagnosed with depressive disorders still should seek and respond to comforting efforts by caregivers. Comorbidity: Conditions associated with neglect, including cognitive delays, language delays, and stereotypies, often co-occur with reactive attachment disorder. Medical conditions, such as severe malnutrition, may accompany signs of the disorder. Depressive symptoms also may co-occur with reactive attachment disorder\nRelationship To Other Classifications:.", "Disorder: Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder\nICD-9: 313. 89, ICD-10: F94. 2\nNotes: \nDiagnostic Criteria:\n  A: A pattern of behavior in which a child actively approaches and interacts with unfamiliar adults and exhibits at least two of the following:\n    - {'dccd_id': '230', 'dcc_id': '289', 'parent_dccd_id': '0', 'dccd_key': '1', 'dccd_value': 'Reduced or absent reticence in approaching and interacting with unfamiliar adults'}\n    - {'dccd_id': '231', 'dcc_id': '289', 'parent_dccd_id': '0', 'dccd_key': '2', 'dccd_value': 'Overly familiar verbal or physical behavior (that is not consistent with culturally sanctioned and with age-appropriate social boundaries).

E: The child has a developmental age of at least 9 months. Disorder Id: 72\nDiagnostic Features: The essential feature of disinhibited social engagement disorder is a pattern of behavior that involves culturally inappropriate, overly familiar behavior with relative strangers (Criterion A). This overly familiar behavior violates the social boundaries of the culture. A diagnosis of disinhibited social engagement disorder should not be made before children are developmentally able to form selective attachments. For this reason, the child must have a developmental age of at least 9 months\nRecording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis: Because of the shared etiological association with social neglect, disinhibited social engagement disorder may co-occur with developmental delays, especially cognitive and language delays, stereotypies, and other signs of severe neglect, such as malnutrition or poor care. However, signs of the disorder often persist even after these other signs of neglect are no longer present. Therefore, it is not uncommon for children with the disorder to present with no current signs of neglect. Moreover, the condition can present in children who show no signs of disordered attachment. Thus, disinhibited social engagement disorder may be seen in children with a history of neglect who lack attachments or whose attachments to their caregivers range from disturbed to secure. Prevalence: The prevalence of disinhibited social attachment disorder is unknown. Nevertheless, the disorder appears to be rare, occurring in a minority of children, even those who have been severely neglected and subsequently placed in foster care or raised in institutions. In such high-risk populations, the condition occurs in only about 20% of children. The condition is seen rarely in other clinical settings. Development And Course: Conditions of social neglect are often present in the first months of life in children diagnosed with disinhibited social engagement disorder, even before the disorder is diagnosed. However, there is no evidence that neglect beginning after age 2 years is associated with manifestations of the disorder. If neglect occurs early and signs of the disorder appear, clinical features of the disorder are moderately stable over time, particularly if conditions of neglect persist. Indiscriminate social behavior and lack of reticence with unfamiliar adults in toddlerhood are accompanied by attention-seeking behaviors in preschoolers. When the disorder persists into middle childhood, clinical features manifest as verbal and physical overfamiliarity as well as inauthentic expression of emotions. These signs appear particularly apparent when the child interacts with adults. Peer relationships are most affected in adolescence, with both indiscriminate behavior and conflicts apparent. The disorder has not been described in adults. Disinhibited social engagement disorder has been described from the second year of life through adolescence. There are some differences in manifestations of the disorder from early childhood through adolescence. At the youngest ages, across many cultures, children show reticence when interacting with strangers. Young children with the disorder fail to show reticence to approach, engage with, and even accompany adults. In preschool children, verbal and social intrusiveness appear most prominent, often accompanied by attention-seeking behavior. Verbal and physical overfamiliarity continue through middle childhood, accompanied by inauthentic expressions of emotion. In adolescence, indiscriminate behavior extends to peers. Relative to healthy adolescents, adolescents with the disorder have more \"superficial\" peer relationships and more peer conflicts. Adult manifestations of the disorder are unknown. Risk And Prognostic Factors: Environmental. Serious social neglect is a diagnostic requirement for disinhibited social engagement disorder and is also the only known risk factor for the disorder. However, the majority of severely neglected children do not develop the disorder. Neurobiological vulnerability may differentiate neglected children who do and do not develop the disorder. However, no clear link with any specific neurobiological factors has been established. The disorder has not been identified in children who experience social neglect only after age 2 years. Prognosis is only modestly associated with quality of the caregiving environment following serious neglect. In many cases, the disorder persists, even in children whose caregiving environment becomes markedly improved. Course modifiers. Caregiving quality seems to moderate the course of disinhibited social engagement disorder. Nevertheless, even after placement in normative caregiving environments, some children show persistent signs of the disorder, at least through adolescence. Culture Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nGender Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nSuicide Risk:  \nFunctional Consequences: Disinhibited social engagement disorder significantly impairs young children's abilities to relate interpersonally to adults and peers\nDiagnostic Markers:  \nDifferential Diagnosis: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Because of social impulsivity that sometimes accompanies attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), it is necessary to differentiate the two disorders. Children with disinhibited social engagement disorder may be distinguished from those with ADHD because the former do not show difficulties with attention or hyperactivity. Comorbidity: Limited research has examined the issue of disorders comorbid with disinhibited social engagement disorder. Conditions associated with neglect, including cognitive delays, language delays, and stereotypies, may co-occur with disinhibited social engagement disorder. In addition, children may be diagnosed with ADHD and disinhibited social engagement disorder concurrently.

'}\nDisorder Id: 73\nDiagnostic Features: The essential feature of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is the development of characteristic symptoms following exposure to one or more traumatic events. Emotional reactions to the traumatic event (e. g. , fear, helplessness, horror) are no longer a part of Criterion A. The clinical presentation of PTSD varies. In some individuals, fear-based reexperiencing, emotional, and behavioral symptoms may predominate. In others, anhedonic or dysphoric mood states and negative cognitions may be most distressing. In some other individuals, arousal and reactive-externalizing symptoms are prominent, while in others, dissociative symptoms predominate. Finally, some individuals exhibit combinations of these symptom patterns. The directly experienced traumatic events in Criterion A include, but are not limited to, exposure to war as a combatant or civilian, threatened or actual physical assault (e. g. , physical attack, robbery, mugging, childhood physical abuse), threatened or actual sexual violence (e. g. , forced sexual penetration, alcohol/drug-facilitated sexual penetration, abusive sexual contact, noncontact sexual abuse, sexual trafficking), being kidnapped, being taken hostage, terrorist attack, torture, incarceration as a prisoner of war, natural or human-made disasters, and severe motor vehicle accidents. For children, sexually violent events may include developmentally inappropriate sexual experiences without physical violence or injury. A life-threatening illness or debilitating medical condition is not necessarily considered a traumatic event. Medical incidents that qualify as traumatic events involve sudden, catastrophic events (e. g. , waking during surgery, anaphylactic shock). Witnessed events include, but are not limited to, observing threatened or serious injury, unnatural death, physical or sexual abuse of another person due to violent assault, domestic violence, accident, war or disaster, or a medical catastrophe in one's child (e. g. , a lifethreatening hemorrhage). Indirect exposure through learning about an event is limited to experiences affecting close relatives or friends and experiences that are violent or accidental (e. g. , death due to natural causes does not qualify). Such events include violent per\u00ad sonal assault, suicide, serious accident, and serious injury. The disorder may be especially severe or long-lasting when the stressor is interpersonal and intentional (e. g. , torture, sexual violence). ^ The traumatic event can be reexperienced in various ways. Commonly, the individual has recurrent, involuntary, and intrusive recollections of the event (Criterion Bl). Intrusive recollections in PTSD are distinguished from depressive rumination in that they apply only to involuntary and intrusive distressing memories. The emphasis is on recurrent memories of the event that usually include sensory, emotional, or physiological behavioral components. A common reexperiencing symptom is distressing dreams that replay the event itself or that are representative or thematically related to the major threats involved in the traumatic event (Criterion B2). The individual may experience dissociative states that last from a few seconds to several hours or even days, during which components of the event are relived and the individual behaves as if the event were occurring at that moment (Criterion B3). Such events occur on a continuum from brief visual or other sensory intrusions about part of the traumatic event without loss of reality orientation, to complete loss of awareness of present surroundings. These episodes, often referred to as \"flashbacks,\" are typically brief but can be associated with prolonged distress and heightened arousal. For young children, reenactment of events related to trauma may appear in play or in dissociative states. Intense psychological distress (Criterion B4) or physiological reactivity (Criterion B5) often occurs when the individual is exposed to triggering events that resemble or symbolize an aspect of the traumatic event (e. g. , windy days after a hurricane; seeing someone who resembles one's perpetrator). The triggering cue could be a physical sensation (e. g. , dizziness for survivors of head trauma; rapid heartbeat for a previously traumatized child), particularly for individuals with highly somatic presentations. Stimuli associated with the trauma are persistently (e. g. , always or almost always) avoided. The individual commonly makes deliberate efforts to avoid thoughts, memories, feelings, or talking about the traumatic event (e. g. , utilizing distraction techniques to avoid internal reminders) (Criterion Cl) and to avoid activities, objects, situations, or people who arouse recollections of it (Criterion C2). Negative alterations in cognitions or mood associated with the event begin or worsen after exposure to the event. These negative alterations can take various forms, including an inability to remember an important aspect of the traumatic event; such amnesia is typically due to dissociative amnesia and is not due to head injury, alcohol, or drugs (Criterion Dl). Another form is persistent (i. e. , always or almost always) and exaggerated negative expectations regarding important aspects of life applied to oneself, others, or the future (e. g. , \"I have always had bad judgment\"; \"People in authority can't be trusted\") that may manifest as a negative change in perceived identity since the trauma (e. g. , \"I can't trust anyone ever again\"; Criterion D2). Individuals with PTSD may have persistent erroneous cognitions about the causes of the traumatic event that lead them to blame themselves or others (e. g. , \"It's all my fault that my uncle abused me\") (Criterion D3). A persistent negative mood state (e. g. , fear, horror, anger, guilt, shame) either began or worsened after exposure to the event (Criterion D4). The individual may experience markedly diminished interest or participation in previously enjoyed activities (Criterion D5), feeling detached or estranged from other people (Criterion D6), or a persistent inability to feel positive emotions (especially happiness, joy, satisfaction, or emotions associated with intimacy, tenderness, and sexuality) (Criterion D7). Individuals with PTSD may be quick tempered and may even engage in aggressive verbal and/or physical behavior with little or no provocation (e. g. , yelling at people, getting into fights, destroying objects) (Criterion El). They may also engage in reckless or selfdestructive behavior such as dangerous driving, excessive alcohol or drug use, or selfinjurious or suicidal behavior (Criterion E2). PTSD is often characterized by a heightened sensitivity to potential threats, including those that are related to the traumatic experience (e. g. , following a motor vehicle accident, being especially sensitive to the threat potentially caused by cars or trucks) and those not related to the traumatic event (e. g. , being fearful of suffering a heart attack) (Criterion E3). Individuals with PTSD may be very reactive to unexpected stimuli, displaying a heightened startle response, or jumpiness, to loud noises or unexpected movements (e. g. , jumping markedly in response to a telephone ringing) (Criterion E4). Concentration difficulties, including difficulty remembering daily events (e. g. , forgetting one's telephone number) or attending to focused tasks (e. g. , following a conversation for a sustained period of time), are commonly reported (Criterion E5). Problems with sleep onset and maintenance are common and may be associated with nightmares and safety concerns or with generalized elevated arousal that interferes with adequate sleep (Criterion E6). Some individuals also experience persistent dissociative symptoms of detachment from their bodies (depersonalization) or the world around them (derealization); this is reflected in the ''with dissociative symptoms\" specifier\nRecording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis: Developmental regression, such as loss of language in young children, may occur. Auditory pseudo-hallucinations, such as having the sensory experience of hearing one's thoughts spoken in one or more different voices, as well as paranoid ideation, can be present. Following prolonged, repeated, and severe traumatic events (e. g. , childhood abuse, torture), the individual may additionally experience difficulties in regulating emotions or maintaining stable interpersonal relationships, or dissociative symptoms. When the traumatic event produces violent death, symptoms of both problematic bereavement and PTSD may be present. Prevalence: In the United States, projected lifetime risk for PTSD using DSM-IV criteria at age 75 years is 8. 7%. Twelve-month prevalence among U. S. adults is about 3. 5%. Lower estimates are seen in Europe and most Asian, African, and Latin American countries, clustering around 0. 5%-L0%. Although different groups have different levels of exposure to traumatic events, the conditional probability of developing PTSD following a similar level of exposure may also vary across cultural groups. Rates of PTSD are higher among veterans and others whose vocation increases the risk of traumatic exposure (e. g. , police, firefighters, emergency medical personnel). Highest rates (ranging from one-third to more than onehalf of those exposed) are found among survivors of rape, military combat and captivity, and ethnically or politically motivated internment and genocide. The prevalence of PTSD may vary across development; children and adolescents, including preschool children, generally have displayed lower prevalence following exposure to serious traumatic events; however, this may be because previous criteria were insufficiently developmentally informed. The prevalence of full-threshold PTSD also appears to be lower among older adults compared with the general population; there is evidence that subthreshold presentations are more common than full PTSD in later life and that these symptoms are associated with substantial clinical impairment. Compared with U. S. non-Latino whites, higher rates of PTSD have been reported among U. S. Latinos, African Americans, and American Indians, and lower rates have been reported among Asian Americans, after adjustment for traumatic exposure and demographic variables. Development And Course: PTSD can occur at any age, beginning after the first year of life. Symptoms usually begin within the first 3 months after the trauma, although there may be a delay of months, or even years, before criteria for the diagnosis are met. There is abundant evidence for what DSM-IV called \"delayed onset\" but is now called \"delayed expression,\" with the recognition that some symptoms typically appear immediately and that the delay is in meeting full criteria. Frequently, an individual's reaction to a trauma initially meets criteria for acute stress disorder in the immediate aftermath of the trauma. The symptoms of PTSD and the relative predominance of different symptoms may vary over time. Duration of the symptoms also varies, with complete recovery within 3 months occurring in approximately one-half of adults, while some individuals remain symptomatic for longer than 12 months and sometimes for more than 50 years. Symptom recurrence and intensification may occur in response to reminders of the original trauma, ongoing life stressors, or newly experienced traumatic events. For older individuals, declining health, worsening cognitive functioning, and social isolation may exacerbate PTSD symptoms. The clinical expression of reexperiencing can vary across development. Young children may report new onset of frightening dreams without content specific to the traumatic event. Before age 6 years (see criteria for preschool subtype), young children are more likely to express reexperiencing symptoms through play that refers directly or symbolically to the trauma. They may not manifest fearful reactions at the time of the exposure or during reexperiencing. Parents may report a wide range of emotional or behavioral changes in young children. Children may focus on imagined interventions in their play or storytelling. In addition to avoidance, children may become preoccupied with reminders. Because of young children's limitations in expressing thoughts or labeling emotions, negative alterations in mood or cognition tend to involve primarily mood changes. Children may experience cooccurring traumas (e. g. , physical abuse, witnessing domestic violence) and in chronic circumstances may not be able to identify onset of symptomatology. Avoidant behavior may be associated with restricted play or exploratory behavior in young children; reduced participation in new activities in school-age children; or reluctance to pursue developmental opportunities in adolescents (e. g. , dating, driving). Older children and adolescents may judge themselves as cowardly. Adolescents may harbor beliefs of being changed in ways that make them socially undesirable and estrange them from peers (e. g. , '\"Now I'll never fit in\") and lose aspirations for the future. Irritable or aggressive behavior in children and adolescents can interfere with peer relationships and school behavior. Reckless behavior may lead to accidental injury to self or others, thrill-seeking, or high-risk behaviors. Individuals who continue to experience PTSD into older adulthood may express fewer symptoms of hyperarousal, avoidance, and negative cognitions and mood compared with younger adults with PTSD, although adults exposed to traumatic events during later life may display more avoidance, hyperarousal, sleep problems, and crying spells than do younger adults exposed to the same traumatic events. In older individuals, the disorder is associated with negative health perceptions, primary care utilization, and suicidal ideation. Risk And Prognostic Factors: Risk (and protective) factors are generally divided into pretraumatic, peritraumatic, and posttraumatic factors. Pretraumatic factors Temperamental. These include childhood emotional problems by age 6 years (e. g. , prior traumatic exposure, externalizing or anxiety problems) and prior mental disorders (e. g. , panic disorder, depressive disorder, PTSD, or obsessive-compulsive disorder [OCD]). Environmental. These include lower socioeconomic status; lower education; exposure to prior trauma (especially during childhood); childhood adversity (e. g. , economic deprivation, family dysRinction, parental separation or death); cultural characteristics (e. g. , fatalistic or self-blaming coping strategies); lower intelligence; minority racial/ethnic status; and a family psychiatric history. Social support prior to event exposure is protective. Genetic and physiological. These include female gender and younger age at the time of trauma exposure (for adults). Certain genotypes may either be protective or increase risk of PTSD after exposure to traumatic events. Peritraumatic factors Environmental. These include severity (dose) of the trauma (the greater the magnitude of trauma, the greater the likelihood of PTSD), perceived life threat, personal injury, interpersonal violence (particularly trauma pe\u03c6etrated by a caregiver or involving a witnessed threat to a caregiver in children), and, for military personnel, being a perpetrator, witnessing atrocities, or killing the enemy. Finally, dissociation that occurs during the trauma and persists afterward is a risk factor. Posttraumatic factors Temperamental. These include negative appraisals, inappropriate coping strategies, and development of acute stress disorder. Environmental. These include subsequent exposure to repeated upsetting reminders, subsequent adverse life events, and financial or other trauma-related losses. Social support (including family stability, for children) is a protective factor that moderates outcome after trauma. Culture Related Diagnostic Issues: The risk of onset and severity of PTSD may differ across cultural groups as a result of variation in the type of traumatic exposure (e. g. , genocide), the impact on disorder severity of the meaning attributed to the traumatic event (e. g. , inability to perform funerary rites after a mass killing), the ongoing sociocultural context (e. g. , residing among unpunished perpetrators in postconflict settings), and other cultural factors (e. g. , acculturative stress in immigrants). The relative risk for PTSD of particular exposures (e. g. , religious persecution) may vary across cultural groups. The clinical expression of the symptoms or symptom clusters of PTSD may vary culturally, particularly with respect to avoidance and numbing symptoms, distressing dreams, and somatic symptoms (e. g. , dizziness, shortness of breath, heat sensations). Cultural syndromes and idioms of distress influence the expression of PTSD and the range of comorbid disorders in different cultures by providing behavioral and cognitive templates that link traumatic exposures to specific symptoms. For example, panic attack symptoms may be salient in PTSD among Cambodians and Latin Americans because of the association of traumatic exposure with panic-like khy\u00e2l attacks and ataque de nervios. Comprehensive evaluation of local expressions of PTSD should include assessment of cultural concepts of distress (see the chapter \"Cultural Formulation\" in Section III). Gender Related Diagnostic Issues: PTSD is more prevalent among females than among males across the lifespan. Females in the general population experience PTSD for a longer duration than do males. At least some of the increased risk for PTSD in females appears to be attributable to a greater likelihood of exposure to traumatic events, such as rape, and other forms of interpersonal violence. Within populations exposed specifically to such stressors, gender differences in risk for PTSD are attenuated or nonsignificant. Suicide Risk: Traumatic events such as childhood abuse increase a person's suicide risk. PTSD is associated with suicidal ideation and suicide attempts, and presence of the disorder may indicate which individuals with ideation eventually make a suicide plan or actually attempt suicide. Functional Consequences: PTSD is associated with high levels of social, occupational, and physical disability, as well as considerable economic costs and high levels of medical utilization. Impaired function\u00ad ing is exhibited across social, inteq:)ersonal, developmental, educational, physical health, and occupational domains. In community and veteran samples, PTSD is associated with poor social and family relationships, absenteeism from work, lower income, and lower educational and occupational success. Diagnostic Markers:  \nDifferential Diagnosis: Adjustment disorders. In adjustment disorders, the stressor can be of any severity or type rather than that required by PTSD Criterion A.", "The diagnosis of an adjustment disorder is used when the response to a stressor that meets PTSD Criterion A does not meet all other PTSD criteria (or criteria for another mental disorder). An adjustment disorder is also diagnosed when the symptom pattern of PTSD occurs in response to a stressor that does not meet PTSD Criterion A (e. g. , spouse leaving, being fired). Other posttraumatic disorders and conditions. Not all psychopathology that occurs in individuals exposed to an extreme stressor should necessarily be attributed to PTSD. The diagnosis requires that trauma exposure precede the onset or exacerbation of pertinent symptoms. Moreover, if the symptom response pattern to the extreme stressor meets criteria for another mental disorder, these diagnoses should be given instead of, or in addition to, PTSD. Other diagnoses and conditions are excluded if they are better explained by PTSD (e. g. , symptoms of panic disorder that occur only after exposure to traumatic reminders). If severe, symptom response patterns to the extreme stressor may warrant a separate diagnosis (e. g. , dissociative amnesia). Acute stress disorder. Acute stress disorder is distinguished from PTSD because the symptom pattern in acute stress disorder is restricted to a duration of 3 days to 1 month following exposure to the traumatic event. Anxiety disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorder. In OCD, there are recurrent intrusive thoughts, but these meet the definition of an obsession. In addition, the intrusive thoughts are not related to an experienced traumatic event, compulsions are usually present, and other symptoms of PTSD or acute stress disorder are typically absent. Neither the arousal and dissociative symptoms of panic disorder nor the avoidance, irritability, and anxiety of generalized anxiety disorder are associated with a specific traumatic event. The symptoms of separation anxiety disorder are clearly related to separation from home or family, rather than to a traumatic event. Major depressive disorder. Major depression may or may not be preceded by a traumatic event and should be diagnosed if other PTSD symptoms are absent. Specifically, major depressive disorder does not include any PTSD Criterion B or C symptoms. Nor does it include a number of symptoms from PTSD Criterion D or E. Personality disorders. Interpersonal difficulties that had their onset, or were greatly exacerbated, after exposure to a traumatic event may be an indication of PTSD, rather than a personality disorder, in which such difficulties would be expected independently of any traumatic exposure. Dissociative disorders. Dissociative amnesia, dissociative identity disorder, and depersonalization-derealization disorder may or may not be preceded by exposure to a traumatic event or may or may not have co-occurring PTSD symptoms. When full PTSD criteria are also met, however, the PTSD ''with dissociative symptoms\" subtype should be considered. Conversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder). New onset of somatic symptoms within the context of posttraumatic distress might be an indication of PTSD rather than conversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder). Psychotic disorders. Flashbacks in PTSD must be distinguished from illusions, hallucinations, and other perceptual disturbances that may occur in schizophrenia, brief psychotic disorder, and other psychotic disorders; depressive and bipolar disorders with psychotic features; delirium; substance/medication-induced disorders; and psychotic disorders due to another medical condition. Traumatic brain injury. When a brain injury occurs in the context of a traumatic event (e. g. , traumatic accident, bomb blast, acceleration/deceleration trauma), sjmnptoms of PTSD may appear. An event causing head trauma may also constitute a psychological traumatic event, and tramautic brain injury (TBI)-related neurocognitive symptoms are not mutually exclusive and may occur concurrently. Symptoms previously termed postconcussive (e. g. , headaches, dizziness, sensitivity to light or sound, irritability, concentration deficits) can occur in braininjured and non-brain-injured populations, including individuals with PTSD. Because symptoms of PTSD and TBI-related neurocognitive symptoms can overlap, a differential diagnosis between PTSD and neurocognitive disorder symptoms attributable to TBI may be possible based on the presence of symptoms that are distinctive to each presentation. Whereas reexperiencing and avoidance are characteristic of PTSD and not the effects of TBI, persistent disorientation and confusion are more specific to TBI (neurocognitive effects) than to PTSD. Comorbidity: Individuals with PTSD are 80% more likely than those without PTSD to have symptoms that meet diagnostic criteria for at least one other mental disorder (e. g. , depressive, bipolar, anxiety, or substance use disorders). Comorbid substance use disorder and conduct disorder are more common among males than among females. Among U. S. military personnel and combat veterans who have been deployed to recent wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, co-occurrence of PTSD and mild TBI is 48%. Although most young children with PTSD also have at least one other diagnosis, the patterns of comorbidity are different than in adults, with oppositional defiant disorder and separation anxiety disorder predominating. Finally, there is considerable comorbidity between PTSD and major neurocognitive disorder and some overlapping symptoms between these disorders.

Disorder Id: 74\nDiagnostic Features: The essential feature of acute stress disorder is the development of characteristic symptoms lasting from 3 days to 1 month following exposure to one or more traumatic events. Traumatic events that are experienced directly include, but are not limited to, exposure to war as a combatant or civilian, threatened or actual violent personal assault (e. g. , sexual violence, physical attack, active combat, mugging, childhood physical and/or sexual violence, being kidnapped, being taken hostage, terrorist attack, torture), natural or humanmade disasters (e. g. , earthquake, hurricane, airplane crash), and severe accident (e. g. , severe motor vehicle, industrial accident). For children, sexually traumatic events may include inappropriate sexual experiences without violence or injury. A life-threatening illness or debilitating medical condition is not necessarily considered a traumatic event. Medical incidents that qualify as traumatic events involve sudden, catastrophic events (e. g. , waking during surgery, anaphylactic shock). Stressful events that do not possess the severe and traumatic components of events encompassed by Criterion A may lead to an adjustment disorder but not to acute stress disorder. The clinical presentation of acute stress disorder may vary by individual but typically involves an anxiety response that includes some form of reexperiencing of or reactivity to the traumatic event. In some individuals, a dissociative or detached presentation can predominate, although these individuals typically will also display strong emotional or physiological reactivity in response to trauma reminders. In other individuals, there can be a strong anger response in which reactivity is characterized by irritable or possibly aggressive responses. The full symptom picture must be present for at least 3 days after the traumatic event and can be diagnosed only up to 1 month after the event. Symptoms that occur immediately after the event but resolve in less than 3 days would not meet criteria for acute stress disorder. Witnessed events include, but are not limited to, observing threatened or serious injury, unnatural death, physical or sexual violence inflicted on another individual as a result of violent assault, severe domestic violence, severe accident, war, and disaster; it may also include witnessing a medical catastrophe (e. g. , a life-threatening hemorrhage) involving one's child. Events experienced indirectly through learning about the event are limited to close relatives or close friends. Such events must have been violent or accidental\u2014death due to natural causes does not qualify\u2014and include violent personal assault, suicide, serious accident, or serious injury. The disorder may be especially severe when the stressor is interpersonal and intentional (e. g. , torture, rape). The likelihood of developing this disorder may increase as the intensity of and physical proximity to the stressor increase. The traumatic event can be reexperienced in various ways. Commonly, the individual has recurrent and intrusive recollections of the event (Criterion Bl). The recollections are spontaneous or triggered recurrent memories of the event that usually occur in response to a stimulus that is reminiscent of the traumatic experience (e. g. , the sound of a backfiring car triggering memories of gunshots). These intrusive memories often include sensory (e. g. , sensing the intense heat that was perceived in a house fire), emotional (e. g. , experiencing the fear of believing that one was about to be stabbed), or physiological (e. g. , experiencing the shortness of breath that one suffered during a near-drowning) components. Distressing dreams may contain themes that are representative of or thematically related to the major threats involved in the traumatic event. (For example, in the case of a motor vehicle accident survivor, the distressing dreams may involve crashing cars generally; in the case of a combat soldier, the distressing dreams may involve being harmed in ways other than combat. ) Dissociative states may last from a few seconds to several hours, or even days, during which components of the event are relived and the individual behaves as though experiencing the event at that moment. While dissociative responses are common during a traumatic event, only dissociative responses that persist beyond 3 days after trauma exposure are considered for the diagnosis of acute stress disorder. For young children, reenactment of events related to trauma may appear in play and may include dissociative moments (e. g. , a child who survives a motor vehicle accident may repeatedly crash toy cars during play in a focused and distressing manner). These episodes, often referred to as flashbacks, are typically brief but involve a sense that the traumatic event is occurring in the present rather than being remembered in the past and are associated with significant distress. Some individuals with the disorder do not have intrusive memories of the event itself, but instead experience intense psychological distress or physiological reactivity when they are exposed to triggering events that resemble or symbolize an aspect of the traumatic event (e. g. , windy days for children after a hurricane, entering an elevator for a male or female who was raped in an elevator, seeing someone who resembles one's perpetrator). The triggering cue could be a physical sensation (e. g. , a sense of heat for a bum victim, dizziness for survivors of head trauma), particularly for individuals with highly somatic presentations. The individual may have a persistent inability to feel positive emotions (e. g. , happiness, joy, satisfaction, or emotions associated with intimacy, tenderness, or sexuality) but can experience negative emotions such as fear, sadness, anger, guilt, or shame. Alterations in awareness can include depersonalization, a detached sense of oneself (e. g. , seeing oneself from the other side of the room), or derealization, having a distorted view of one's surroundings (e. g. , perceiving that things are moving in slow motion, seeing things in a daze, not being aware of events that one would normally encode). Some individuals also report an inability to remember an important aspect of the traumatic event that was presumably encoded. This symptom is attributable to dissociative amnesia and is not attributable to head injury, alcohol, or drugs. Stimuli associated with the trauma are persistently avoided. The individual may refuse to discuss the traumatic experience or may engage in avoidance strategies to minimize awareness of emotional reactions (e. g. , excessive alcohol use when reminded of the experience). This behavioral avoidance may include avoiding watching news coverage of the traumatic experience, refusing to return to a workplace where the trauma occurred, or avoiding interacting with others who shared the same traumatic experience. It is very common for individuals with acute stress disorder to experience problems with sleep onset and maintenance, which may be associated with nightmares or with generalized elevated arousal that prevents adequate sleep. Individuals with acute stress disorder may be quick tempered and may even engage in aggressive verbal and/or physical behavior with little provocation. Acute stress disorder is often characterized by a heightened sensitivity to potential threats, including those that are related to the traumatic experience (e. g. , a motor vehicle accident victim may be especially sensitive to the threat potentially caused by any cars or trucks) or those not related to the traumatic event (e. g. , fear of having a heart attack). Concentration difficulties, including difficulty remembering daily events (e. g. , forgetting one's telephone number) or attending to focused tasks (e. g. , following a conversation for a sustained period of time), are commonly reported. Individuals with acute stress disorder may be very reactive to unexpected stimuli, displaying a heightened startle response or jumpiness to loud noises or unexpected movements (e. g. , the individual may jump markedly in the response to a telephone ringing). Recording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis: Individuals with acute stress disorder commonly engage in catastrophic or extremely negative thoughts about their role in the traumatic event, their response to the traumatic experience, or the likelihood of future harm. For example, an individual with acute stress disorder may feel excessively guilty about not having prevented the traumatic event or about not adapting to the experience more successfully. Individuals with acute stress disorder may also interpret their symptoms in a catastrophic manner, such that flashback memories or emotional numbing may be interpreted as a sign of diminished mental capacity. It is common for individuals with acute stress disorder to experience panic attacks in the initial month after trauma exposure that may be triggered by trauma reminders or may apparently occur spontaneously. Additionally, individuals with acute stress disorder may display chaotic or impulsive behavior. For example, individuals may drive recklessly, make irrational decisions, or gamble excessively. In children, there may be significant separation anxiety, possibly manifested by excessive needs for attention from caregivers. In the case of bereavement following a death that occurred in traumatic circumstances, the symptoms of acute stress disorder can involve acute grief reactions. In such cases, reexperiencing, dissociative, and arousal symptoms may involve reactions to the loss, such as intrusive memories of the circumstances of the individual's death, disbelief that the individual has died, and anger about the death. Postconcussive symptoms (e. g. , headaches, dizziness, sensitivity to light or sound, irritability, concentration deficits), which occur frequently following mild traumatic brain injury, are also frequently seen in individuals with acute stress disorder. Postconcussive symptoms are equally common in brain-injured and non-brain-injured populations, and the frequent occurrence of postconcussive symptoms could be attributable to acute stress disorder symptoms. Prevalence: The prevalence of acute stress disorder in recently trauma-exposed populations (i. e. , within 1 month of trauma exposure) varies according to the nature of the event and the context in which it is assessed. In both U. S. and non-U. S. populations, acute stress disorder tends to be identified in less than 20% of cases following traumatic events that do not involve interpersonal assault; 13%-21% of motor vehicle accidents, 14% of mild traumatic brain injury, 19% of assault, 10% of severe burns, and 6%-12% of industrial accidents. Higher rates (i. e. , 20%-50%) are reported following interpersonal traumatic events, including assault, rape, and witnessing a mass shooting. Development And Course: Acute stress disorder cannot be diagnosed until 3 days after a traumatic event. Although acute stress disorder may progress to posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after 1 month, it may also be a transient stress response that remits within 1 month of trauma exposure and does not result in PTSD. Approximately half of individuals who eventually develop PTSD initially present with acute stress disorder. Symptom worsening during the initial month can occur, often as a result of ongoing life stressors or further traumatic events. The forms of reexperiencing can vary across development. Unlike adults or adolescents, young children may report frightening dreams without content that clearly reflects aspects of the trauma (e. g. , waking in fright in the aftermath of the trauma but being unable to relate the content of the dream to the traumatic event). Children age 6 years and younger are more likely than older children to express reexperiencing symptoms through play that refers directly or symbolically to the trauma. For example, a very young child who survived a fire may draw pictures of flames. Young children also do not necessarily manifest fearful reactions at the time of the exposure or even during reexperiencing. Parents typically report a range of emotional expressions, such as anger, shame, or withdrawal, and even excessively bright positive affect, in young children who are traumatized. Although children may avoid reminders of the trauma, they sometimes become preoccupied with reminders (e. g. , a young child bitten by a dog may talk about dogs constantly yet avoid going outside because of fear of coming into contact with a dog). Risk And Prognostic Factors: Temperamental. Risk factors include prior mental disorder, high levels of negative affectivity (neuroticism), greater perceived severity of the traumatic event, and an avoidant coping style. Catastrophic appraisals of the traumatic experience, often characterized by exaggerated appraisals of future harm, guilt, or hopelessness, are strongly predictive of acute stress disorder. Environmental. First and foremost, an individual must be exposed to a traumatic event to be at risk for acute stress disorder. Risk factors for the disorder include a history of prior trauma. Genetic and physiological. Females are at greater risk for developing acute stress disorder. Elevated reactivity, as reflected by acoustic startle response, prior to trauma exposure increases the risk for developing acute stress disorder. Culture Related Diagnostic Issues: The profile of symptoms of acute stress disorder may vary cross-culturally, particularly with respect to dissociative symptoms, nightmares, avoidance, and somatic symptoms (e. g. , dizziness, shortness of breath, heat sensations). Cultural syndromes and idioms of distress shape the local symptom profiles of acute stress disorder. Some cultural groups may display variants of dissociative responses, such as possession or trancelike behaviors in the initial month after trauma exposure. Panic symptoms may be salient in acute stress disorder among Cambodians because of the association of traumatic exposure with paniclike khy\u00e2l attacks, and ataque de nervios among Latin Americans may also follow a traumatic exposure. Gender Related Diagnostic Issues: Acute stress disorder is more prevalent among females than among males. Sex-linked neurobiological differences in stress response may contribute to females' increased risk for acute stress disorder. The increased risk for the disorder in females may be attributable in part to a greater likelihood of exposure to the types of traumatic events with a high conditional risk for acute stress disorder, such as rape and other interpersonal violence. Suicide Risk:  \nFunctional Consequences: Impaired functioning in social, interpersonal, or occupational domains has been shown across survivors of accidents, assault, and rape who develop acute stress disorder. The extreme levels of anxiety that may be associated with acute stress disorder may interfere with sleep, energy levels, and capacity to attend to tasks. Avoidance in acute stress disorder can result in generalized withdrawal from many situations that are perceived as potentially threatening, which can lead to nonattendance of medical appointments, avoidance of driving to important appointments, and absenteeism from work. Diagnostic Markers:  \nDifferential Diagnosis: Adjustment disorders. In acute stress disorder, the stressor can be of any severity rather than of the severity and type required by Criterion A of acute stress disorder. The diagnosis of an adjustment disorder is used when the response to a Criterion A event does not meet the criteria for acute stress disorder (or another specific mental disorder) and when the symptom pattern of acute stress disorder occurs in response to a stressor that does not meet Criterion A for exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence (e. g. , spouse leaving, being fired). For example, severe stress reactions to life-threatening illnesses that may include some acute stress disorder symptoms may be more appropriately described as an adjustment disorder. Some forms of acute stress response do not include acute stress disorder symptoms and may be characterized by anger, depression, or guilt. These responses are more appropriately described as primarily an adjustment disorder. Depressive or anger responses in an adjustment disorder may involve rumination about the traumatic event, as opposed to involuntary and intrusive distressing memories in acute stress disorder. Panic disorder. Spontaneous panic attacks are very common in acute stress disorder. However, panic disorder is diagnosed only if panic attacks are unexpected and there is anxiety about future attacks or maladaptive changes in behavior associated with fear of dire consequences of the attacks. Dissociative disorders. Severe dissociative responses (in the absence of characteristic acute stress disorder symptoms) may be diagnosed as derealization/depersonalization disorder. If severe amnesia of the trauma persists in the absence of characteristic acute stress disorder symptoms, the diagnosis of dissociative amnesia may be indicated. Posttraumatic stress disorder. Acute stress disorder is distinguished from PTSD because the symptom pattern in acute stress disorder must occur within 1 month of the traumatic event and resolve within that 1-month period. If the symptoms persist for more than 1 month and meet criteria for PTSD, the diagnosis is changed from acute stress disorder to PTSD. Obsessive-compulsive disorder. In obsessive-compulsive disorder, there are recurrent intrusive thoughts, but these meet the definition of an obsession. In addition, the intrusive thoughts are not related to an experienced traumatic event, compulsions are usually present, and other symptoms of acute stress disorder are typically absent. Psychotic disorders. Flashbacks in acute stress disorder must be distinguished from illusions, hallucinations, and other perceptual disturbances that may occur in schizophrenia, other psychotic disorders, depressive or bipolar disorder with psychotic features, a delirium, substance/medication-induced disorders, and psychotic disorders due to another medical condition. Acute stress disorder flashbacks are distinguished from these other perceptual disturbances by being directly related to the traumatic experience and by occurring in the absence of other psychotic or substance-induced features. Traumatic brain injury. When a brain injury occurs in the context of a traumatic event (e. g. , traumatic accident, bomb blast, acceleration/deceleration trauma), symptoms of acute stress disorder may appear. An event causing head trauma may also constitute a psychological traumatic event, and tramautic brain injury (TBI)-related neurocognitive symptoms are not mutually exclusive and may occur concurrently. Symptoms previously termed postconcussive (e. g. , headaches, dizziness, sensitivity to light or sound, irritability, concentration deficits) can occur in brain-injured and non-brain injured populations, including individuals with acute stress disorder. Because symptoms of acute stress disorder and TBI-related neurocognitive symptoms can overlap, a differential diagnosis between acute stress disorder and neurocognitive disorder symptoms attributable to TBI may be possible based on the presence of symptoms that are distinctive to each presentation. Whereas reexperiencing and avoidance are characteristic of acute stress disorder and not the effects of TBI, persistent disorientation and confusion are more specific to TBI (neurocognitive effects) than to acute stress disorder. Furthermore, differential is aided by the fact that symptoms of acute stress disorder persist for up to only 1 month following trauma exposure. Comorbidity:  \nRelationship To Other Classifications:.", "Disorder: Adjustment Disorders\nICD-9: Variable, ICD-10: Variable\nNotes: \nDiagnostic Criteria:\n  A: The development of emotional or behavioral symptoms in response to an identifiable stressor(s) occurring within 3 months of the onset of the stressor(s).

D: The symptoms do not represent normal bereavement. E: Once the stressor or its consequences have terminated, the symptoms do not persist for more than an additional 6 months. Disorder Id: 75\nDiagnostic Features: The presence of emotional or behavioral symptoms in response to an identifiable stressor is the essential feature of adjustment disorders (Criterion A). The stressor may be a single event (e. g. , a termination of a romantic relationship), or there may be multiple stressors (e. g. , marked business difficulties and marital problems). Stressors may be recurrent (e. g. , associated with seasonal business crises, unfulfilling sexual relationships) or continuous (e. g. , a persistent painful illness with increasing disability, living in a crime-ridden neighborhood). Stressors may affect a single individual, an entire family, or a larger group or community (e. g. , a natural disaster). Some stressors may accompany specific developmental events (e. g. , going to school, leaving a parental home, reentering a parental home, getting married, becoming a parent, failing to attain occupational goals, retirement). Adjustment disorders may be diagnosed following the death of a loved one when the intensity, quality, or persistence of grief reactions exceeds what normally might be expected, when cultural, religious, or age-appropriate norms are taken into account. A more specific set of bereavement-related symptoms has been designated persistent complex bereavement disorder. Adjustment disorders are associated with an increased risk of suicide attempts and completed suicide. Recording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis:  \nPrevalence: Adjustment disorders are common, although prevalence may vary widely as a function of the population studied and the assessment methods used. The percentage of individuals in outpatient mental health treatment with a principal diagnosis of an adjustment disorder ranges from approximately 5% to 20%. In a hospital psychiatric consultation setting, it is often the most common diagnosis, frequently reaching 50%. Development And Course: By definition, the disturbance in adjustment disorders begins within 3 months of onset of a stressor and lasts no longer than 6 months after the stressor or its consequences have ceased. If the stressor is an acute event (e. g. , being fired from a job), the onset of the disturbance is usually immediate (i. e. , within a few days) and the duration is relatively brief (i. e. , no more than a few months). If the stressor or its consequences persist, the adjustment disorder may also continue to be present and become the persistent form. Risk And Prognostic Factors: Environmental. Individuals from disadvantaged life circumstances experience a high rate of stressors and may be at increased risk for adjustment disorders\nCulture Related Diagnostic Issues: The context of the individual's cultural setting should be taken into account in making the clinical judgment of whether the individual's response to the stressor is maladaptive or whether the associated distress is in excess of what would be expected. The nature, meaning, and experience of the stressors and the evaluation of the response to the stressors may vary across cultures\nGender Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nSuicide Risk:  \nFunctional Consequences: The subjective distress or impairment in functioning associated with adjustment disorders is frequently manifested as decreased performance at work or school and temporary changes in social relationships. An adjustment disorder may complicate the course of illness in individuals who have a general medical condition (e. g. , decreased compliance with the recommended medical regimen; increased length of hospital stay)\nDiagnostic Markers:  \nDifferential Diagnosis: Major depressive disorder. If an individual has symptoms that meet criteria for a major depressive disorder in response to a stressor, the diagnosis of an adjustment disorder is not applicable. The symptom profile of major depressive disorder differentiates it from adjustment disorders. Posttraumatic stress disorder and acute stress disorder. In adjustment disorders, the stressor can be of any severity rather than of the severity and type required by Criterion A of acute stress disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In distinguishing adjustment disorders from these two posttraumatic diagnoses, there are both timing and symptom profile considerations. Adjustment disorders can be diagnosed immediately and persist up to 6 months after exposure to the traumatic event, whereas acute stress disorder can only occur between 3 days and 1 month of exposure to the stressor, and PTSD cannot be diagnosed until at least 1 month has passed since the occurrence of the traumatic stressor. The required symptom profile for PTSD and acute stress disorder differentiates them from the adjustment disorders. With regard to symptom profiles, an adjustment disorder may be diagnosed following a traumatic event when an individual exhibits symptoms of either acute stress disorder or PTSD that do not meet or exceed the diagnostic threshold for either disorder. An adjustment disorder should also be diagnosed for individuals who have not been exposed to a traumatic event but who otherwise exhibit the full symptom profile of either acute stress disorder or PTSD. Personality disorders. With regard to personality disorders, some personality features may be associated with a vulnerability to situational distress that may resemble an adjustment disorder. The lifetime history of personality functioning will help inform the interpretation of distressed behaviors to aid in distinguishing a long-standing personality disorder from an adjustment disorder. In addition to some personality disorders incurring vulnerability to distress, stressors may also exacerbate personality disorder symptoms. In the presence of a personality disorder, if the symptom criteria for an adjustment disorder are met, and the stress-related disturbance exceeds what may be attributable to maladaptive personality disorder symptoms (i. e. . Criterion C is met), then the diagnosis of an adjustment disorder should be made. Psychological factors affecting other medical conditions. In psychological factors affecting other medical conditions, specific psychological entities (e. g. , psychological symptoms, behaviors, other factors) exacerbate a medical condition. These psychological factors can precipitate, exacerbate, or put an individual at risk for medical illness, or they can worsen an existing condition. In contrast, an adjustment disorder is a reaction to the stressor (e. g. , having a medical illness). Normative stress reactions. When bad things happen, most people get upset. This is not an adjustment disorder. The diagnosis should only be made when the magnitude of the distress (e. g. , alterations in mood, anxiety, or conduct) exceeds what would normally be expected (which may vary in different cultures) or when the adverse event precipitates functional impairment. Comorbidity: Adjustment disorders can accompany most mental disorders and any medical disorder. Adjustment disorders can be diagnosed in addition to another mental disorder only if the latter does not explain the particular symptoms that occur in reaction to the stressor. For example, an individual may develop an adjustment disorder, with depressed mood, after losing a job and at the same time have a diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder. Or, an individual may have a depressive or bipolar disorder and an adjustment disorder as long as the criteria for both are met. Adjustment disorders are common accompaniments of medical illness and may be the major psychological response to a medical disorder.

The overtness or covertness of these personality states, however, varies as a function of psychological motivation, current level of stress, culture, internal conflicts and dynamics, and emotional resilience. Sustained periods of identity disruption may occur when psychosocial pressures are severe and/or prolonged. In many possession-form cases of dissociative identity disorder, and in a small proportion of non-possession-form cases, manifestations of alternate identities are highly overt. Most individuals with non-possession-form dissociative identity disorder do not overtly display their discontinuity of identity for long periods of time; only a small minority present to clinical attention with observable alternation of identities. When alternate personality states are not directly observed, the disorder can be identified by two clusters of symptoms: 1) sudden alterations or discontinuities in sense of self and sense \u03bf\u03af agency (Criterion A), and 2) recurrent dissociative amnesias (Criterion B). Criterion A symptoms are related to discontinuities of experience that can affect any aspect of an individual's functioning. Individuals v^ith dissociative identity disorder may report the feeling that they have suddenly become depersonalized observers of their \"own\" speech and actions, which they may feel powerless to stop (sense of self). Such individuals may also report perceptions of voices (e. g. , a child's voice; crying; the voice of a spiritual being). In some cases, voices are experienced as multiple, perplexing, independent thought streams over which the individual experiences no control. Strong emotions, impulses, and even speech or other actions may suddenly emerge, without a sense of personal ownership or control (sense of agency). These emotions and impulses are frequently reported as ego-dystonic and puzzling. Attitudes, outlooks, and personal preferences (e. g. , about food, activities, dress) may suddenly shift and then shift back. Individuals may report that their bodies feel different (e. g. , like a small child, like the opposite gender, huge and muscular). Alterations in sense of self and loss of personal agency may be accompanied by a feeling that these attitudes, emotions, and behaviors\u2014even one's body\u2014are \"not mine\" and/or are \"not under my control. \" Although most Criterion A symptoms are subjective, many of these sudden discontinuities in speech, affect, and behavior can be witnessed by family, friends, or the clinician. Non-epileptic seizures and other conversion symptoms are prominent in some presentations of dissociative identity disorder, especially in some non-Westem settings. The dissociative amnesia of individuals with dissociative identity disorder manifests in three primary ways: as 1) gaps in remote memory of personal life events (e. g. , periods of childhood or adolescence; some important life events, such as the death of a grandparent, getting married, giving birth); 2) lapses in dependable memory (e. g. , of what happened today, of well-leamed skills such as how to do their job, use a computer, read, drive); and 3) discovery of evidence of their everyday actions and tasks that they do not recollect doing (e. g. , finding unexplained objects in their shopping bags or among their possessions; finding perplexing writings or drawings that they must have created; discovering injuries; \"coming to\" in the midst of doing something). Dissociative fugues, wherein the person discovers dissociated travel, are common. Thus, individuals with dissociative identity disorder may report that they have suddenly found themselves at the beach, at work, in a nightclub, or somewhere at home (e. g. , in the closet, on a bed or sofa, in the corner) with no memory of how they came to be there. Amnesia in individuals with dissociative identity disorder is not limited to stressful or traumatic events; these individuals often cannot recall everyday events as well. Individuals with dissociative identity disorder vary in their awareness and attitude toward their amnesias. It is common for these individuals to minimize their amnestic symptoms. Some of their amnestic behaviors may be apparent to others\u2014as when these persons do not recall something they were witnessed to have done or said, when they cannot remember their own name, or when they do not recognize their spouse, children, or close friends. Possession-form identities in dissociative identity disorder typically manifest as behaviors that appear as if a \"spirit,\" supernatural being, or outside person has taken control, such that the individual begins speaking or acting in a distinctly different manner. For example, an individual's behavior may give the appearance that her identity has been replaced by the \"ghost\" of a girl who committed suicide in the same community years before, speaking and acting as though she were still alive. Or an individual may be \"taken over\" by a demon or deity, resulting in profound impairment, and demanding that the individual or a relative be punished for a past act, followed by more subtle periods of identity alteration. However, the majority of possession states around the world are normal, usually part of spiritual practice, and do not meet criteria for dissociative identity disor- der. The identities that arise during possession-form dissociative identity disorder present recurrently, are unvs^anted and involuntary, cause clinically significant distress or impairment (Criterion C), and are not a normal part of a broadly accepted cultural or religious practice (Criterion D)\nRecording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis: Individuals with dissociative identity disorder typically present v^ith comorbid depression, anxiety, substance abuse, self-injury, non-epileptic seizures, or another common symptom. They often conceal, or are not fully aware of, disruptions in consciousness, amnesia, or other dissociative symptoms. Many individuals with dissociative identity disorder report dissociative flashbacks during which they undergo a sensory reliving of a previous event as though it were occurring in the present, often with a change of identity, a partial or complete loss of contact with or disorientation to current reality during the flashback, and a subsequent amnesia for the content of the flashback. Individuals with the disorder typically report multiple types of interpersonal maltreatment during childhood and adulthood. Nonmaltreatment forms of overwhelming early life events, such as multiple long, painful, early-life medical procedures, also may be reported. Self-mutilation and suicidal behavior are frequent. On standardized measures, these individuals report higher levels of hypnotizability and dissociativity compared with other clinical groups and healthy control subjects. Some individuals experience transient psychotic phenomena or episodes. Several brain regions have been implicated in the pathophysiology of dissociative identity disorder, including the orbitofrontal cortex, hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and amygdala. Prevalence: The 12-month prevalence of dissociative identity disorder among adults in a small U. S. community study was 1. 5%. The prevalence across genders in that study was 1. 6% for males and 1. 4% for females. Development And Course: Dissociative identity disorder is associated with overwhelming experiences, traumatic events, and/or abuse occurring in childhood. The full disorder may first manifest at almost any age (from earliest childhood to late life). Dissociation in children may generate problems with memory, concentration, attachment, and traumatic play. Nevertheless, children usually do not present with identity changes; instead they present primarily with overlap and interference among mental states (Criterion A phenomena), wi\u00fci symptoms related to discontinuities of experience. Sudden changes in identity during adolescence may appear to be just adolescent turmoil or the early stages of another mental disorder. Older individuals may present to treatment with what appear to be late-life mood disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, paranoia, psychotic mood disorders, or even cognitive disorders due to dissociative amnesia. In some cases, disruptive affects and memories may increasingly intrude into awareness with advancing age. Psychological decompensation and overt changes in identity may be triggered by 1) removal from the traumatizing situation (e. g. , through leaving home); 2) the individual's children reaching the same age at which the individual was originally abused or traumatized; 3) later traumatic experiences, even seemingly inconsequential ones, like a minor motor vehicle accident; or 4) the death of, or the onset of a fatal illness in, their abuser(s). Risk And Prognostic Factors: Environmental. Inte\u03c6ersonal physical and sexual abuse is associated with an increased risk of dissociative identity disorder. Prevalence of childhood abuse and neglect in the United States, Canada, and Europe among those with the disorder is about 90%. Other forms of traumatizing experiences, including childhood medical and surgical procedures, war, childhood prostitution, and terrorism, have been reported. Course modifiers. Ongoing abuse, later-life retraumatization, comorbidity with mental disorders, severe medical illness, and delay in appropriate treatment are associated with poorer prognosis\nCulture Related Diagnostic Issues: Many features of dissociative identity disorder can be influenced by the individual's cultural background. Individuals with this disorder may present with prominent medically unexplained neurological symptoms, such as non-epileptic seizures, paralyses, or sensory loss, in cultural settings where such symptoms are common. Similarly, in settings where normative possession is common (e. g. , rural areas in the developing world, among certain religious groups in the United States and Europe), the fragmented identities may take the form of possessing spirits, deities, demons, animals, or mythical figures. Acculturation or prolonged intercultural contact may shape the characteristics of the other identities (e. g. , identities in India may speak English exclusively and wear Western clothes). Possessionform dissociative identity disorder can be distinguished from culturally accepted possession states in that the former is involuntary, distressing, uncontrollable, and often recurrent or persistent; involves conflict between the individual and his or her surrounding family, social, or work milieu; and is manifested at times and in places that violate the norms of the culture or religion. Gender Related Diagnostic Issues: Females with dissociative identity disorder predominate in adult clinical settings but not in child clinical settings. Adult males with dissociative identity disorder may deny their symptoms and trauma histories, and this can lead to elevated rates of false negative diagnosis. Females with dissociative identity disorder present more frequently with acute dissociative states (e. g. , flashbacks, amnesia, fugue, functional neurological [conversion] symptoms, hallucinations, self-mutilation). Males commonly exhibit more criminal or violent behavior than females; among males, common triggers of acute dissociative states include combat, prison conditions, and physical or sexual assaults\nSuicide Risk: Over 70% of outpatients with dissociative identity disorder have attempted suicide; multiple attempts are common, and other self-injurious behavior is frequent. Assessment of suicide risk may be complicated when there is amnesia for past suicidal behavior or when the presenting identity does not feel suicidal and is unaware that other dissociated identities do. Functional Consequences: Impairment varies widely, from apparently minimal (e. g. , in high-functioning professionals) to profound. Regardless of level of disability, individuals with dissociative identity disorder commonly minimize the impact of their dissociative and posttraumatic symptoms. The symptoms of higher-functioning individuals may impair their relational, marital, family, and parenting functions more than their occupational and professional life (although the latter also may be affected). With appropriate treatment, many impaired individuals show marked improvement in occupational and personal functioning. However, some remain highly impaired in most activities of living. These individuals may only respond to treatment very slowly, with gradual reduction in or improved tolerance of their dissociative and posttraumatic symptoms. Long-term supportive treatment may slowly increase these individuals' ability to manage their symptoms and decrease use of more restrictive levels of care. Diagnostic Markers:  \nDifferential Diagnosis: Other specified dissociative disorder. The core of dissociative identity disorder is the division of identity, v^ith recurrent disruption of conscious functioning and sense of self. This central feature is shared with one form of other specified dissociative disorder, which may be distinguished from dissociative identity disorder by the presence of chronic or recurrent mixed dissociative symptoms that do not meet Criterion A for dissociative identity disorder or are not accompanied by recurrent amnesia. Major depressive disorder. Individuals with dissociative identity disorder are often depressed, and their symptoms may appear to meet the criteria for a major depressive episode. Rigorous assessment indicates that this depression in some cases does not meet full criteria for major depressive disorder. Other specified depressive disorder in individuals with dissociative identity disorder often has an important feature: the depressed mood and cognitions fluctuate because they are experienced in some identity states but not others. Bipolar disorders. Individuals with dissociative identity disorder are often misdiagnosed with a bipolar disorder, most often bipolar II disorder. The relatively rapid shifts in mood in individuals with this disorder\u2014typically within minutes or hours, in contrast to the slower mood changes typically seen in individuals with bipolar disorders\u2014are due to the rapid, subjective shifts in mood commonly reported across dissociative states, sometimes accompanied by fluctuation in levels of activation. Furthermore, in dissociative identity disorder, elevated or depressed mood may be displayed in conjunction with overt identities, so one or the other mood may predominate for a relatively long period of time (often for days) or may shift within minutes. Posttraumatic stress disorder. Some traumatized individuals have both posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and dissociative identity disorder. Accordingly, it is crucial to distinguish between individuals with PTSD only and individuals who have both PTSD and dissociative identity disorder. This differential diagnosis requires that the clinician establish the presence or absence of dissociative symptoms that are not characteristic of acute stress disorder or PTSD. Some individuals with PTSD manifest dissociative symptoms that also occur in dissociative identity disorder: 1) amnesia for some aspects of trauma, 2) dissociative flashbacks (i. e. , reliving of the trauma, with reduced awareness of one's current orientation), and 3) symptoms of intrusion and avoidance, negative alterations in cognition and mood, and hyperarousal that are focused around the traumatic event. On the other hand, individuals with dissociative identity disorder manifest dissociative symptoms that are not a manifestation of PTSD: 1) amnesias for many everyday (i. e. , nontraumatic) events, 2) dissociative flashbacks that may be followed by amnesia for the content of the flashback, 3) disruptive intrusions (unrelated to traumatic material) by dissociated identity states into the individual's sense of self and agency, and 4) infrequent, full-blown changes among different identity states. Psychotic disorders. Dissociative identity disorder may be confused with schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders. The personified, internally communicative inner voices of dissociative identity disorder, especially of a child (e. g. , \"I hear a little girl crying in a closet and an angry man yelling at her\"), may be mistaken for psychotic hallucinations. Dissociative experiences of identity fragmentation or possession, and of perceived loss of control over thoughts, feelings, impulses, and acts, may be confused with signs of formal thought disorder, such as thought insertion or withdrawal. Individuals with dissociative identity disorder may also report visual, tactile, olfactory, gustatory, and somatic hallucinations, which are usually related to posttraumatic and dissociative factors, such as partial flashbacks. Individuals with dissociative identity disorder experience these symptoms as caused by alternate identities, do not have delusional explanations for the phenomena, and often describe the symptoms in a personified way (e. g. , \"I feel like someone else wants to cry with my eyes\"). Persecutory and derogatory internal voices in dissociative identity disorder associated with depressive symptoms may be misdiagnosed as major depression with psychotic features. Chaotic identity change and acute intrusions that disrupt thought processes may be distinguished from brief psychotic disorder by the predominance of dissociative symptoms and amnesia for the episode, and diagnostic evaluation after cessation of the crisis can help confirm the diagnosis. Substance/medication-induced disorders. Symptoms associated with the physiological effects of a substance can be distinguished from dissociative identity disorder if the substance in question is judged to be etiologically related to the disturbance. Personality disorders. Individuals with dissociative identity disorder often present identities that appear to encapsulate a variety of severe personality disorder features, suggesting a differential diagnosis of personality disorder, especially of tiie borderline type. Importantly, however, the individual's longitudinal variability in personality style (due to inconsistency among identities) differs from the pervasive and persistent dysfunction in affect management and inte\u03c6ersonal relationships typical of those with personality disorders. Conversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder). This disorder may be distinguished from dissociative identity disorder by the absence of an identity disruption characterized by two or more distinct personality states or an experience of possession. Dissociative amnesia in conversion disorder is more limited and circumscribed (e. g. , amnesia for a non-epileptic seizure). Seizure disorders. Individuals with dissociative identity disorder may present with seizurelike symptoms and behaviors that resemble complex partial seizures with temporal lobe foci. These include d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu, jamais vu, depersonalization, derealization, out-of-body experiences, amnesia, disruptions of consciousness, hallucinations, and other intrusion phenomena of sensation, affect, and thought. Normal electroencephalographic findings, including telemetry, differentiate non-epileptic seizures from the seizurelike symptoms of dissociative identity disorder. Also, individuals with dissociative identity disorder obtain very high dissociation scores, whereas individuals with complex partial seizures do not. Factitious disorder and malingering. Individuals who feign dissociative identity disorder do not report the subtle symptoms of intrusion characteristic of the disorder; instead they tend to overreport well-publicized symptoms of the disorder, such as dissociative amnesia, while underreporting less-publicized comorbid symptoms, such as depression. Individuals who feign dissociative identity disorder tend to be relatively undisturbed by or may even seem to enjoy \"having\" the disorder. In contrast, individuals with genuine dissociative identity disorder tend to be ashamed of and overwhelmed by their symptoms and to underreport their symptoms or deny their condition. Sequential observation, corroborating history, and intensive psychometric and psychological assessment may be helpful in assessment. Individuals who malinger dissociative identity disorder usually create limited, stereotyped alternate identities, with feigned amnesia, related to the events for which gain is sought. For example, they may present an \"all-good\" identity and an \"all-bad\" identity in hopes of gaining exculpation for a crime\nComorbidity: Many individuals with dissociative identity disorder present with a comorbid disorder. If not assessed and treated specifically for the dissociative disorder, these individuals often receive prolonged treatment for the comorbid diagnosis only, with limited overall treatment response and resultant demoralization, and disability. Individuals with dissociative identity disorder usually exhibit a large number of comorbid disorders. In particular, most develop PTSD. Other disorders that are highly comorbid with dissociative identity disorder include depressive disorders, trauma- and stressor-related disorders, personality disorders (especially avoidant and borderline personality disorders), conversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder), somatic symptom disorder, eating disorders, substance-related disorders, obsessivecompulsive disorder, and sleep disorders. Dissociative alterations in identity, memory, and consciousness may affect the symptom presentation of comorbid disorders. Relationship To Other Classifications:.", "Disorder: Dissociative Amnesia\nICD-9: 300. 12, ICD-10: F44. 0\nNotes: \nDiagnostic Criteria:\n  A: An inability to recall important autobiographical information, usually of a traumatic or stressful nature, that is inconsistent with ordinary forgetting. Note: Dissociative amnesia most often consists of localized or selective amnesia for a specific event or events; or generalized amnesia for identity and life history. B: The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. C: The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e. g. , alcohol or other drug of abuse, a medication) or a neurological or other medical condition (e. g. , partial complex seizures, transient global amnesia, sequelae of a closed head injury/traumatic brain injury, other neurological condition\n  D: The disturbance is not better explained by dissociative identity disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, acute stress disorder, somatic symptom disorder, or major or mild neurocognitive disorder\nDisorder Id: 79\nDiagnostic Features: The defining characteristic of dissociative amnesia is an inability to recall important autobiographical information that 1) should be successfully stored in memory and 2) ordinarily would be readily remembered (Criterion A). Dissociative amnesia differs from the permanent amnesias due to neurobiological damage or toxicity that prevent memory storage or retrieval in that it is always potentially reversible because the memory has been successfully stored. Localized amnesia, a failure to recall events during a circumscribed period of time, is the most common form of dissociative amnesia. Localized amnesia may be broader than amnesia for a single traumatic event (e. g. , months or years associated with child abuse or intense combat). In selective amnesia, the individual can recall some, but not all, of the events during a circumscribed period of time. Thus, the individual may remember part of a traumatic event but not other parts. Some individuals report both localized and selective amnesias. Generalized amnesia, a complete loss of memory for one's life history, is rare. Individuals with generalized amnesia may forget personal identity. Some lose previous knowledge about the world (i. e. , semantic knowledge) and can no longer access well-learned skills (i. e. , procedural knowledge). Generalized amnesia has an acute onset; the perplexity, disorientation, an4 purposeless wandering of individuals with generalized amnesia usually bring them to the attention of the police or psychiatric emergency services. Generalized amnesia may be more common among combat veterans, sexual assault victims, and individuals experiencing extreme emotional stress or conflict. Individuals with dissociative amnesia are frequently unaware (or only partially aware) of their memory problems. Many, especially those with localized amnesia, minimize the importance of their memory loss and may become uncomfortable when prompted to address it. In systematized amnesia, the individual loses memory for a specific category of information (e. g. , all memories relating to one's family, a particular person, or childhood sexual abuse). In continuous amnesia, an individual forgets each new event as it occurs. Recording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis: Many individuals with dissociative amnesia are chronically impaired in their ability to form and sustain satisfactory relationships. Histories of trauma, child abuse, and victimization are common. Some individuals with dissociative amnesia report dissociative flashbacks (i. e. , behavioral reexperiencing of traumatic events). Many have a history of selfmutilation, suicide attempts, and other high-risk behaviors. Depressive and functional neurological symptoms are common, as are depersonalization, auto-hypnotic symptoms, and high hypnotizability. Sexual dysfunctions are common. Mild traumatic brain injury may precede dissociative amnesia. Prevalence: The 12-month prevalence for dissociative amnesia among adults in a small U. S. community study was 1. 8% (1. 0% for males; 2. 6% for females). Development And Course: Onset of generalized amnesia is usually sudden. Less is known about the onset of localized and selective amnesias because these amnesias are seldom evident, even to the individual. Although overwhelming or intolerable events typically precede localized amnesia, its onset may be delayed for hours, days, or longer. Individuals may report multiple episodes of dissociative amnesia. A single episode may predispose to future episodes. In between episodes of amnesia, the individual may or may not appear to be acutely symptomatic. The duration of the forgotten events can range from minutes to decades. Some episodes of dissociative amnesia resolve rapidly (e. g. , when the person is removed from combat or some other stressful situation), whereas other episodes persist for long periods of time. Some individuals may gradually recall the dissociated memories years later. Dissociative capacities may decline with age, but not always. As the amnesia remits, there may be considerable distress, suicidal behavior, and symptoms of posttrauma tic stress disorder (PTSD). Dissociative amnesia has been observed in young children, adolescents, and adults. Children may be the most difficult to evaluate because they often have difficulty understanding questions about amnesia, and interviewers may find it difficult to formulate childfriendly questions about memory and amnesia. Observations of apparent dissociative amnesia are often difficult to differentiate from inattention, absorption, anxiety, oppositional behavior, and learning disorders. Reports from several different sources (e. g. , teacher, therapist, case worker) may be needed to diagnose amnesia in children. Risk And Prognostic Factors: Environmental. Single or repeated traumatic experiences (e. g. , war, childhood maltreatment, natural disaster, internment in concentration camps, genocide) are common ante\u00ad cedents. Dissociative amnesia is more likely to occur with 1) a greater number of adverse childhood experiences, particularly physical and/or sexual abuse, 2) interpersonal violence; and 3) increased severity, frequency, and violence of the trauma. Genetic and physiological. There are no genetic studies of dissociative amnesia. Studies of dissociation report significant genetic and environmental factors in both clinical and nonclinical samples. Course modifiers. Removal from the traumatic circumstances underlying the dissociative amnesia (e. g. , combat) may bring about a rapid return of memory. The memory loss of individuals with dissociative fugue may be particularly refractory. Onset of PTSD symptoms may decrease localized, selective, or systematized amnesia. The returning memory, however, may be experienced as flashbacks that alternate with amnesia for the content of the flashbacks. Culture Related Diagnostic Issues: In Asia, the Middle East, and Latin America, non-epileptic seizures and other functional neurological symptoms may accompany dissociative amnesia. In cultures with highly restrictive social traditions, the pr\u00e9cipitants of dissociative amnesia often do not involve frank trauma. Instead, the amnesia is preceded by severe psychological stresses or conflicts (e. g. , marital conflict, other family disturbances, attachment problems, conflicts due to restriction or oppression). Gender Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nSuicide Risk: Suicidal and other self-destructive behaviors are common in individuals with dissociative amnesia. Suicidal behavior may be a particular risk when the amnesia remits suddenly and overwhelms the individual with intolerable memories. Functional Consequences: The impairment of individuals with localized, selective, or systematized dissociative amnesia ranges from limited to severe. Individuals with chronic generalized dissociative amnesia usually have impairment in all aspects of functioning. Even when these individuals \"re-leam\" aspects of their life history, autobiographical memory remains very impaired. Most become vocationally and interpersonally disabled\nDiagnostic Markers:  \nDifferential Diagnosis: Dissociative identity disorder. Individuals with dissociative amnesia may report depersonalization and auto-hypnotic symptoms. Individuals with dissociative identity disorder report pervasive discontinuities in sense of self and agency, accompanied by many other dissociative symptoms. The amnesias of individuals with localized, selective, and/ or systematized dissociative amnesias are relatively stable. Anmesias in dissociative identity disorder include amnesia for everyday events, finding of unexplained possessions, sudden fluctuations in skills and knowledge, major gaps in recall of life history, and brief amnesic gaps in interpersonal interactions. Posttraumatic stress disorder. Some individuals with PTSD cannot recall part or all of a specific traumatic event (e. g. , a rape victim with depersonalization and/or derealization symptoms who cannot recall most events for the entire day of the rape). When that amnesia extends beyond the immediate time of the trauma, a comorbid diagnosis of dissociative amnesia is warranted. Neurocognitive disorders. In neurocognitive disorders, memory loss for personal information is usually embedded in cognitive, linguistic, affective, attentional, and behavioral disturbances. In dissociative amnesia, memory deficits are primarily for autobiographical information; intellectual and cognitive abilities are preserved. Substance-related disorders. In the context of repeated intoxication with alcohol or other substances/medications, there may be episodes of \"^lack outs\" or periods for which the individual has no memory. To aid in distinguishing these episodes from dissociative amnesia, a longitudinal history noting that the amnestic episodes occur only in the context of intoxication and do not occur in other situations would help identify the source as substance-induced; however the distinction may be difficult when the individual with dissociative amnesia may also misuse alcohol or other substances in the context of stressful situations that may also exacerbate dissociative symptoms. Some individuals with comorbid dissociative amnesia and substance use disorders will attribute their memory problems solely to the substance use. Prolonged use of alcohol or other substances may result in a substance-induced neurocognitive disorder that may be associated with impaired cognitive function, but in this context the protracted history of substance use and the persistent deficits associated with the neurocognitive disorder would serve to distinguish it from dissociative amnesia, where there is typically no evidence of persistent impairment in intellectual functioning. Posttraumatic amnesia due to brain injury. Amnesia may occur in the context of a traumatic brain injury (TBI) when there has been an impact to the head or other mechai\u00fcsms of rapid movement or displacement of the brain within the skull TBI. Other characteristics of TBI include loss of consciousness, disorientation and confusion, or, in more severe cases, neurological signs (e. g. , abnormalities on neuroimaging, a new onset of seizures or a marked worsening of a preexisting seizure disorder, visual field cuts, anosmia). A neurocognitive disorder attributable to TBI must present either immediately after brain injury occurs or immediately after the individual recovers consciousness after the injury, and persist past the acute post-injury period. The cognitive presentation of a neurocognitive disorder following TBI is variable and includes difficulties in the domains of complex attention, executive function, learning and memory as well as slowed speed of information processing and disturbances in social cognition. These additional features help distinguish it from dissociative amnesia. Seizure disorders. Individuals with seizure disorders may exhibit complex behavior during seizures or post-ictally with subsequent amnesia. Some individuals with a seizure disorder engage in nonpurposive wandering that is limited to the period of seizure activity. Conversely, behavior during a dissociative fugue is usually purposeful, complex, and goaldirected and may last for days, weeks, or longer. Occasionally, individuals with a seizure disorder will report that earlier autobiographical memories have been \"wiped out\" as the seizure disorder progresses. Such memory loss is not associated with traumatic circumstances and appears to occur randomly. Serial electroencephalograms usually show abnormalities. Telemetric electroencephalographic monitoring usually shows an association between the episodes of amnesia and seizure activity. Dissociative and epileptic amnesias may coexist. Catatonic stupor. Mutism in catatonic stupor may suggest dissociative amnesia, but failure of recall is absent. Other catatonic symptoms (e. g. , rigidity, posturing, negativism) are usually present. Factitious disorder and malingering. There is no test, battery of tests, or set of procedures that invariably distinguishes dissociative amnesia from feigned amnesia. Individuals with factitious disorder or malingering have been noted to continue their deception even during hypnotic or barbiturate-facilitated interviews. Feigned amnesia is more common in individuals with 1) acute, florid dissociative amnesia; 2) financial, sexual, or legal problems; or 3) a wish to escape stressful circumstances. True amnesia can be associated with those same circumstances. Many individuals who malinger confess spontaneously or when confronted. Normal and age-related changes in memory. Memory decrements in major and mild neurocognitive disorders differ from those of dissociative amnesia, which are usually associated with stressful events and are more specific, extensive, and/or complex. Comorbidity: As dissociative anmesia begins to remit, a wide variety of affective phenomena may surface: dysphoria, grief, rage, shame, guilt, psychological conflict and turmoil, and suicidal and homicidal ideation, impulses, and acts. These individuals may have symptoms that then meet diagnostic criteria for persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia); major depressive disorder; other specified or unspecified depressive disorder; adjustment disorder, with depressed mood; or adjustment disorder, with mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct. Many individuals with dissociative amnesia develop PTSD at some point during their life, especially when the traumatic antecedents of their amnesia are brought into conscious awareness. Many individuals with dissociative amnesia have symptoms that meet diagnostic criteria for a comorbid somatic symptom or related disorder (and vice versa), including somatic symptom disorder and conversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder). Many individuals with dissociative amnesia have symptoms that meet diagnostic criteria for a personality disorder, especially dependent, avoidant, and borderline\nRelationship To Other Classifications:.", "Disorder: Depersonalization/Derealization Disorder\nICD-9: 300. 6, ICD-10: F48. 1\nNotes: \nDiagnostic Criteria:\n  A: The presence of persistent or recurrent experiences of depersonalization, derealization, or both:\n  B: During the depersonalization or derealization experiences, reality testing remains intact. C: The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. D: The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e. g. , a drug of abuse, medication) or another medical condition (e. g. , seizures)\n  E: The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder, such as schizophrenia, panic disorder, major depressive disorder, acute stress disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, or another dissociative disorder. Disorder Id: 80\nDiagnostic Features: The essential features of depersonalization/derealization disorder are persistent or recurrent episodes of depersonalization, derealization, or both. Episodes of depersonalization are characterized by a feeling of unreality or detachment from, or unfamiliarity with, one's whole self or from aspects of the self (Criterion Al). The individual may feel detached from his or her entire being (e. g. , \"I am no one,\" \"I have no self\"). He or she may also feel subjectively detached from aspects of the self, including feelings (e. g. , hypoemotionality: \"I know I have feelings but I don't feel them\"), thoughts (e. g. , \"My thoughts don't feel like my own,\" \"head^filled with cotton\"), whole body or body parts, or sensations (e. g. , touch, proprioception, hunger, thirst, libido). There may also be a diminished sense of agency (e. g. , feeling robotic, like an automaton; lacking control of one's speech or movements). The depersonalization experience can sometimes be one of a split self, with one part observing and one participating, known as an \"out-of-body experience\" in its most extreme form. The unitary symptom of \"depersonalization\" consists of several symptom factors: anomalous body experiences (i. e. , unreality of the self and perceptual alterations); emotional or physical numbing; and temporal distortions with anomalous subjective recall. Episodes of derealization are characterized by a feeling of unreality or detachment from, or unfamiliarity with, the world, be it individuals, inanimate objects, or all surroundings (Criterion A2). TTie individual may feel as if he or she were in a fog, dream, or bubble, or as if there were a veil or a glass wall between the individual and world around. Surroundings may be experienced as artificial, colorless, or lifeless. Derealization is commonly accompanied by subjective visual distortions, such as blurriness, heightened acuity, widened or narrowed visual field, two-dimensionality or flatness, exaggerated three-dimensionality, or altered distance or size of objects (i. e. , macropsia or micropsia). Auditory distortions can also occur, whereby voices or sounds are muted or heightened. In addition. Criterion C requires the presence of clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of fimctioning, and Criteria D and E describe exclusionary diagnoses. Recording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis: Individuals with depersonalization/derealization disorder may have difficulty describing their symptoms and may think they are \"crazy\" or \"going crazy\". Another common experience is the fear of irreversible brain damage. A commonly associated symptom is a subjectively altered sense of time (i. e. , too fast or too slow), as well as a subjective difficulty in vividly recalling past memories and owning them as personal and emotional. Vague somatic symptoms, such as head fullness, tingling, or lightheadedness, are not uncommon. Individuals may suffer extreme rumination or obsessional preoccupation (e. g. , constantly obsessing about whether they really exist, or checking their perceptions to determine whether they appear real). Varying degrees of anxiety and depression are also common associated features. Individuals with the disorder have been found to have physiological hyporeactivity to emotional stimuli. Neural substrates of interest include the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis, inferior parietal lobule, and prefrontal cortical-limbic circuits\nPrevalence: Transient depersonalization/derealization symptoms lasting hours to days are common in the general population. The 12-month prevalence of depersonalization/derealization disorder is thought to be markedly less than for transient symptoms, although precise estimates for the disorder are unavailable. In general, approximately one-half of all adults have experienced at least one lifetime episode of depersonalization/derealization. However, symptomatology that meets full criteria for depersonalization/derealization disorder is markedly less common than transient symptoms. Lifetime prevalence in U. S. and non-U. S. countries is approximately 2% (range of 0. 8% to 2. 8%). T\u00ceie gender ratio for the disorder is 1:1. Development And Course: The mean age at onset of depersonalization/derealization disorder is 16 years, although the disorder can start in early or middle childhood; a minority cannot recall ever not having had the symptoms. Less than 20% of individuals experience onset after age 20 years and only 5% after age 25 years. Onset in the fourth decade of life or later is highly unusual. Onset can range from extremely sudden to gradual. Duration of depersonalization/derealization disorder episodes can vary greatly, from brief (hours or days) to prolonged (weeks, months, or years). Given the rarity of disorder onset after age 40 years, in such cases the individual should be examined more closely for underlying medical conditions (e. g. , brain lesions, seizure disorders, sleep apnea). The course of the disorder is often persistent. About one-third of cases involve discrete episodes; another third, continuous symptoms from the start; and still another third, an initially episodic course that eventually becomes continuous. While in some individuals the intensity of symptoms can wax and wane considerably, others report an unwavering level of intensity that in extreme cases can be constantly present for years or decades. Internal and external factors that affect symptom intensity vary between individuals, yet some typical patterns are reported. Exacerbations can be triggered by stress, worsening mood or anxiety symptoms, novel or overstimulating settings, and physical factors such as lighting or lack of sleep. Risk And Prognostic Factors: Temperamental. Individuals with depersonalization/derealization disorder are characterized by harm-avoidant temperament, immature defenses, and both disconnection and overconnection schemata. Immature defenses such as idealization/devaluation, projection and acting out result in denial of reality and poor adaptation. Cognitive disconnection schemata reflect defectiveness and emotional inhibition and subsume themes of abuse, neglect, and deprivation. Overconnection schemata involve impaired autonomy with themes of dependency, vulnerability, and incompetence. Environmental. There is a clear association between the disorder and childhood interpersonal traumas in a substantial portion of individuals, although this association is not as prevalent or as extreme in the nature of the traumas as in other dissociative disorders, such as dissociative identity disorder. In particular, emotional abuse and emotional neglect have been most strongly and consistently associated with the disorder. Other stressors can include physical abuse; witnessing domestic violence; growing up with a seriously impaired, mentally ill parent; or unexpected death or suicide of a family member or close Wend. Sexual abuse is a much less common antecedent but can be encountered. The most common proximal pr\u00e9cipitants of the disorder are severe stress (interpersonal, financial, occupational), depression, anxiety (particularly panic attacks), and illicit drug use. Symptoms may be specifically induced by substances such as tetrahydrocannabinol, hallucinogens, ketamine, MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine; \"ecstasy\") and salvia. Marijuana use may precipitate new-onset panic attacks and depersonalization/derealization symptoms simultaneously. Culture Related Diagnostic Issues: Volitionally induced experiences of depersonalization/derealization can be a part of meditative practices that are prevalent in many religions and cultures and should not be diagnosed as a disorder. However, there are individuals who initially induce these states intentionally but over time lose control over them and may develop a fear and aversion for related practices. Gender Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nSuicide Risk:  \nFunctional Consequences: Symptoms of depersonalization/derealization disorder are highly distressing and are associated with major morbidity. The affectively flattened and robotic demeanor that these individuals often demonstrate may appear incongruent with the extreme emotional pain reported by those with the disorder. Impairment is often experienced in both interpersonal and occupational spheres, largely due to the hypoemotionaHty with others, subjective difficulty in focusing and retaining information, and a general sense of disconnectedness from life\nDiagnostic Markers:  \nDifferential Diagnosis: Illness anxiety disorder. Although individuals with depersonalization/derealization disorder can present with vague somatic complaints as well as fears of permanent brain damage, the diagnosis of depersonalization/derealization disorder is characterized by the presence of a constellation of typical depersonalization/derealization symptoms and the absence of other manifestations of illness anxiety disorder. Major depressive disorder. Feelings of numbness, deadness, apathy, and being in a dream are not uncommon in major depressive episodes. However, in depersonalization/ derealization disorder, such symptoms are associated with further symptoms of the disorder. If the depersonalization/derealization clearly precedes the onset of a major depressive episode or clearly continues after its resolution, the diagnosis of depersonalization/ derealization disorder applies. Obsessive-compulsive disorder. Some individuals with depersonalization/derealization disorder can become obsessively preoccupied with their subjective experience or develop rituals checking on the status of their symptoms. However, other symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder unrelated to depersonalization/derealization are not present. Other dissociative disorders. In order to diagnose depersonalization/derealization disorder, the symptoms should not occur in the context of another dissociative disorder, such as dissociative identity disorder. Differentiation from dissociative amnesia and conversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder) is simpler, as the symptoms of these disorders do not overlap with those of depersonalization/derealization disorder. Anxiety disorders. Depersonalization/derealization is one of the symptoms of panic attacks, increasingly common as panic attack severity increases. Therefore, depersonalization/dereahzation disorder should not be diagnosed when the symptoms occur only during panic attacks that are part of panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, or specific phobia. In addition, it is not uncommon for depersonalization/derealization symptoms to first begin in the context of new-onset panic attacks or as panic disorder progresses and worsens. In such presentations, the diagnosis of depersonalization/derealization disorder can be made if 1) the depersonalization/derealization component of the presentation is very prominent from the start, clearly exceeding in duration and intensity the occurrence of actual panic attacks; or 2) the depersonalization/derealization continues after panic disorder has remitted or has been successfully treated. Psychotic disorders. The presence of intact reality testing specifically regarding the depersonalization/derealization symptoms is essential to differentiating depersonalization/derealization disorder from psychotic disorders. Rarely, positive-symptom schizophrenia can pose a diagnostic challenge when nihilistic delusions are present. For example, an individual may complain that he or she is dead or the world is not real; this could be either a subjective experience that the individual knows is not true or a delusional conviction. Substance/medication-induced disorders. Depersonalization/derealization associated with the physiological effects of substances during acute intoxication or withdrawal is not diagnosed as depersonalization/derealization disorder. The most common precipitating substances are the illicit drugs marijuana, hallucinogens, ketamine, ecstasy, and salvia. In about 15% of all cases of depersonalization/derealization disorder, the symptoms are precipitated by ingestion of such substances. If the symptoms persist for some time in the absence of any further substance or medication use, the diagnosis of depersonalization/ derealization disorder applies. This diagnosis is usually easy to establish since the vast majority of individuals with this presentation become highly phobic and aversive to the triggering substance and do not use it again. Mental disorders due to another medical condition. Features such as onset after age 40 years or the presence of atypical symptoms and course in any individual suggest the possibility of an underlying medical condition. In such cases, it is essential to conduct a thorough medical and neurological evaluation, which may include standard laboratory studies, viral titers, an electroencephalogram, vestibular testing, visual testing, sleep studies, and/or brain imaging. When the suspicion of an underlying seizure disorder proves difficult to confirm, an ambulatory electroencephalogram may be indicated; although temporal lobe epilepsy is most commonly implicated, parietal and frontal lobe epilepsy may also be associated. Comorbidity: In a convenience sample of adults recruited for a number of depersonalization research studies, lifetime comorbidities were high for unipolar depressive disorder and for any anxiety disorder, with a significant proportion of the sample having both disorders. Comorbidity with posttraumatic stress disorder was low. The three most commonly co-occurring personality disorders were avoidant, borderline, and obsessive-compulsive\nRelationship To Other Classifications:.", "Disorder: Other Specified Dissociative Disorder\nICD-9: 300. 15, ICD-10: F44. 89\nNotes: This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a dissociative disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the dissociative disorders diagnostic class. The other specified dissociative disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific dissociative disorder. This is done by recording \u201cother specified dissociative disorder\u201d followed by the specific reason (e. g. , \u201cdissociative trance\u201d)\nDiagnostic Criteria:\n  1: Chronic and recurrent syndromes of mixed dissociative symptoms: This category includes identity disturbance associated with less-than-marked discontinuities in sense of self and agency, or alterations of identity or episodes of possession in an individual who reports no dissociative amnesia. 2: identity disturbance due to proionged and intense coercive persuasion: Individuals who have been subjected to intense coercive persuasion (e. g. , brainwashing, thought reform, indoctrination while captive, torture, long-term political imprisonment, recruitment by sects/cults or by terror organizations) may present with prolonged changes in, or conscious questioning of, their identity. 3: Acute dissociative reactions to stressfui events: This category is for acute, transient conditions that typically last less than 1 month, and sometimes only a few hours or days. These conditions are characterized by constriction of consciousness; depersonalization; derealization; perceptual disturbances (e. g. , time slowing, macropsia); micro-amnesias; transient stupor; and/or alterations in sensory-motor functioning (e. g. , analgesia, paralysis). 4: Dissociative trance: This condition is characterized by an acute narrowing or complete loss of awareness of immediate surroundings that manifests as profound unresponsiveness or insensitivity to environmental stimuli. The unresponsiveness may be accompanied by minor stereotyped behaviors (e. g. , finger movements) of which the individual is unaware and/or that he or she cannot control, as well as transient paralysis or loss of consciousness. The dissociative trance is not a normal part of a broadly accepted collective cultural or religious practice\nProperties:.", "Disorder: Unspecified Dissociative Disorder\nICD-9: 300. 15, ICD-10: F44. 9\nNotes: This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a dissociative disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the dissociative disorders diagnostic class. The unspecified dissociative disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for a specific dissociative disorder, and includes presentations for which there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis (e. g. , in emergency room settings)\nDiagnostic Criteria:\nProperties:.", "Disorder: Somatic Symptom Disorder\nICD-9: 300. 82, ICD-10: F45. 1\nNotes: \nDiagnostic Criteria:\n  A: One or more somatic symptoms that are distressing or result in significant disruption of daily life\n  B: Excessive thoughts, feelings, or behaviors related to the somatic symptoms or associated health concerns as manifested by at least one of the following:\n    - {'dccd_id': '322', 'dcc_id': '330', 'parent_dccd_id': '0', 'dccd_key': '1', 'dccd_value': 'Disproportionate and persistent thoughts about the seriousness of one\u2019s symptoms'}\n    - {'dccd_id': '323', 'dcc_id': '330', 'parent_dccd_id': '0', 'dccd_key': '2', 'dccd_value': 'Persistently high level of anxiety about health or symptoms.

'}\n  C: Although any one somatic symptom may not be continuously present, the state of being symptomatic is persistent (typically more than 6 months). Disorder Id: 83\nDiagnostic Features: Individuals with somatic symptom disorder typically have multiple, current, somatic symptoms that are distressing or result in significant disruption of daily life (Criterion A), although sometimes only one severe symptom, most commonly pain, is present. Symptoms may be specific (e. g. , localized pain) or relatively nonspecific (e. g. , fatigue). The symptoms sometimes represent normal bodily sensations or discomfort that does not generally signify serious disease. Somatic symptoms without an evident medical explanation are not sufficient to make this diagnosis. The individual's suffering is authentic, whether or not it is medically explained. The symptoms may or may not be associated with another medical condition. The diagnoses of somatic symptom disorder and a concurrent medical illness are not mutually exclusive, and these frequently occur together. For example, an individual may become seriously disabled by symptoms of somatic symptom disorder after an uncomplicated myocardial infarction even if the myocardial infarction itself did not result in any disability. If another medical condition or high risk for developing one is present (e. g. , strong family history), the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors associated with this condition are excessive (Criterion B). Individuals with somatic symptom disorder tend to have very high levels of worry about illness (Criterion B). They appraise their bodily symptoms as unduly threatening, harmful, or troublesome and often think the worst about their health. Even when there is evidence to the contrary, some patients still fear the medical seriousness of their symptoms. In severe somatic symptom disorder, health concerns may assume a central role in the individual's life, becoming a feature of his or her identity and dominating interpersonal relationships. Individuals typically experience distress that is principally focused on somatic symptoms and their significance. When asked directly about their distress, some individuals describe it in relation to other aspects of their lives, while others deny any source of distress other than the somatic symptoms. Health-related quality of life is often impaired, both physically and mentally. In severe somatic symptom disorder, the impairment is marked, and when persistent, the disorder can lead to invalidism. There is often a high level of medical care utilization, which rarely alleviates the individual's concerns. Consequently, the patient may seek care from multiple doctors for the same symptoms. These individuals often seem unresponsive to medical interventions, and new interventions may only exacerbate the presenting symptoms. Some individuals with the disorder seem unusually sensitive to medication side effects. Some feel that their medical assessment and treatment have been inadequate. Recording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis: Cognitive features include attention focused on somatic symptoms, attribution of normal bodily sensations to physical illness (possibly with catastrophic interpretations), worry about illness, and fear that any physical activity may damage the body. The relevant associated behavioral features may include repeated bodily checking for abnormalities, repeated seeking of medical help and reassurance, and avoidance of physical activity. These behavioral features are most pronounced in severe, persistent somatic symptom disorder. These features are usually associated with frequent requests for medical help for different somatic symptoms. This may lead to medical consultations in which individuals are so focused on their concerns about somatic symptom(s) that they cannot be redirected to other matters. Any reassurance by the doctor that the symptoms are not indicative of serious physical illness tends to be short-lived and/or is experienced by the individuals as the doctor not taking their symptoms with due seriousness. As the focus on somatic symptoms is a primary feature of the disorder, individuals with somatic symptom disorder typically present to general medical health services rather than mental health services. The suggestion of referral to a mental health specialist may be met with surprise or even frank refusal by individuals with somatic symptom disorder. Since somatic symptom disorder is associated with depressive disorders, there is an increased suicide risk. It is not known whether somatic symptom disorder is associated with suicide risk independent of its association with depressive disorders. Prevalence: The prevalence of somatic symptom disorder is not known. However, the prevalence of somatic symptom disorder is expected to be higher than that of the more restrictive DSMIV somatization disorder (<1%) but lower than that of undifferentiated somatoform disorder (approximately 19%). The prevalence of somatic symptom disorder in the general adult population may be around 5%-7%. Females tend to report more somatic symptoms than do males, and the prevalence of somatic symptom disorder is consequently likely to be higher in females\nDevelopment And Course: In older individuals, somatic symptoms and concurrent medical illnesses are common, and a focus on Criterion B is crucial for making the diagnosis. Somatic symptom disorder may be underdiagnosed in older adults either because certain somatic symptoms (e. g. , pain, fatigue) are considered part of normal aging or because illness worry is considered \"understandable\" in older adults who have more general medical illnesses and medications than do younger people. Concurrent depressive disorder is common in older people who present with numerous somatic symptoms. In children, the most common symptoms are recurrent abdominal pain, headache, fatigue, and nausea. A single prominent symptom is more common in children than in adults. While young children may have somatic complaints, they rarely worry about \"illness\" per se prior to adolescence. The parents' response to the symptom is important, as this may determine the level of associated distress. It is the parent who may determine the interpretation of symptoms and the associated time off school and medical help seeking. Risk And Prognostic Factors: Temperamental. The personality trait of negative affectivity (neuroticism) has been identified as an independent correlate/risk factor of a high number of somatic symptoms. Comorbid anxiety or depression is common and may exacerbate symptoms and impairment. Environmental. Somatic symptom disorder is more frequent in individuals with few years of education and low socioeconomic status, and in those who have recently experienced stressful life events. Course modifiers. Persistent somatic symptoms are associated with demographic features (female sex, older age, fewer years of education, lower socioeconomic status, unemployment), a reported history of sexual abuse or other childhood adversity, concurrent chronic physical illness or psychiatric disorder (depression, anxiety, persistent depressive disorder [dysthymia], panic), social stress, and reinforcing social factors such as illness benefits. Cognitive factors that affect clinical course include sensitization to pain, heightened attention to bodily sensations, and attribution of bodily symptoms to a possible medical illness rather than recognizing them as a normal phenomenon or psychological stress. Culture Related Diagnostic Issues: Somatic sjmnptoms are prominent in various \"culture-bound syndromes. \" High numbers of somatic symptoms are found in population-based and primary care studies aroimd the world, with a similar pattern of the most commonly reported somatic symptoms, impairment, and treatment seeking. The relationship between number of somatic symptoms and illness worry is similar in different cultures, and marked illness worry is associated with impairment and greater treatment seeking across cultures. The relationship between numerous somatic symptoms and depression appears to be very similar around the world and between different cultures within one country. Despite these similarities, there are differences in somatic symptoms among cultures and ethnic groups. The description of somatic symptoms varies with linguistic and other local cultural factors. These somatic presentations have been described as \"idioms of distress\" because somatic symptoms may have special meanings and shape patient-clinician interactions in the particular cultural contexts. \"Burnout,\" the sensation of heaviness or the complaints of \"gas\"; too much heat in the body; or burning in the head are examples of symptoms that are common in some cultures or ethnic groups but rare in others. Explanatory models also vary, and somatic symptoms may be attributed variously to particular family, work, or environmental stresses; general medical illness; the suppression of feelings of anger and resentment; or certain culture-specific phenomena, such as semen loss. There may also be differences in medical treatment seeking among cultural groups, in addition to differences due to variable access to medical care services. Seeking treatment for multiple somatic symptoms in general medical clinics is a worldwide phenomenon and occurs at similar rates among ethnic groups in the same country. Gender Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nSuicide Risk:  \nFunctional Consequences: The disorder is associated with marked impairment of health status. Many individuals with severe somatic symptom disorder are likely to have impaired health status scores more than 2 standard deviations below population norms\nDiagnostic Markers:  \nDifferential Diagnosis: If the somatic symptoms are consistent with another mental disorder (e. g. , panic disorder), and the diagnostic criteria for that disorder are fulfilled, then that mental disorder should be considered as an alternative or additional diagnosis. A separate diagnosis of somatic symptom disorder is not made if the somatic symptoms and related thoughts, feelings, or behaviors occur only during major depressive episodes. If, as commonly occurs, the criteria for both somatic symptom disorder and another mental disorder diagnosis are fulfilled, then both should be coded, as both may require treatment. Other medical conditions. The presence of somatic symptoms of unclear etiology is not in itself sufficient to make the diagnosis of somatic symptom disorder. The symptoms of many individuals with disorders like irritable bowel syndrome or fibromyalgia would not satisfy the criterion necessary to diagnose somatic symptom disorder (Criterion B). Conversely, the presence of somatic symptoms of an established medical disorder (e. g. , diabetes or heart disease) does not exclude the diagnosis of somatic symptom disorder if the criteria are otherwise met. Panic disorder. In panic disorder, somatic symptoms and anxiety about health tend to occur in acute episodes, whereas in somatic symptom disorder, anxiety and somatic symptoms are more persistent. Generalized anxiety disorder. Individuals with generalized anxiety disorder worry about multiple events, situations, or activities, only one of which may involve their health. The main focus is not usually somatic symptoms or fear of illness as it is in somatic symptom disorder. Depressive disorders. Depressive disorders are commonly accompanied by somatic symptoms. However, depressive disorders are differentiated from somatic symptom disorder by the core depressive symptoms of low (dysphoric) mood and anhedonia. Illness anxiety disorder. If the individual has extensive worries about health but no or minimal somatic symptoms, it may be more appropriate to consider illness anxiety disorder. Conversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder). In conversion disorder, the presenting symptom is loss of function (e. g. , of a limb), whereas in somatic symptom disorder, the focus is on the distress that particular symptoms cause. The features listed under Criterion B of somatic symptom disorder may be helpful in differentiating the two disorders. Delusional disorder. In somatic symptom disorder, the individual's beliefs that somatic symptoms might reflect serious underlying physical illness are not held with delusional intensity. Nonetheless, the individual's beliefs concerning the somatic symptoms can be firmly held. In contrast, in delusional disorder, somatic subtype, the somatic symptom beliefs and behavior are stronger than those found in somatic symptom disorder. Body dysmorphic disorder. In body dysmorphic disorder, the individual is excessively concerned about, and preoccupied by, a perceived defect in his or her physical features. In contrast, in somatic symptom disorder, the concern about somatic symptoms reflects fear of underlying illness, not of a defect in appearance. Obsessive-compulsive disorder. In somatic symptom disorder, the recurrent ideas about somatic symptoms or illness are less intrusive, and individuals with this disorder do not exhibit the associated repetitive behaviors aimed at reducing anxiety that occur in obsessive-compulsive disorder. Comorbidity: Somatic symptom disorder is associated with high rates of comorbidity with medical disorders as well as anxiety and depressive disorders. When a concurrent medical illness is present, the degree of impairment is more marked than would be expected from the physical illness alone. When an individual's symptoms meet diagnostic criteria for somatic symptom disorder, the disorder should be diagnosed; however, in view of the frequent comorbidity, especially with anxiety and depressive disorders, evidence for these concurrent diagnoses should be sought. Relationship To Other Classifications:.", "Disorder: Illness Anxiety Disorder\nICD-9: 300. 7, ICD-10: F45. 21\nNotes: \nDiagnostic Criteria:\n  A: Preoccupation with having or acquiring a serious illness. B: Somatic symptoms are not present or, if present, are only mild in intensity. If another medical condition is present or there is a high risk for developing a medical condition (e. g. , strong family history is present), the preoccupation is clearly excessive or disproportionate\n  C: There is a high level of anxiety about health, and the individual is easily alarmed about personal health status. D: The individual performs excessive health-related behaviors (e. g. , repeatedly checks his or her body for signs of illness) or exhibits maladaptive avoidance (e. g. , avoids doctor appointments and hospitals). E: Illness preoccupation has been present for at least 6 months, but the specific illness that is feared may change over that period of time. F: The illness-related preoccupation is not better explained by another mental disorder, such as somatic symptom disorder, panic disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, body dysmorphic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, or delusional disorder, somatic type. Disorder Id: 84\nDiagnostic Features: Most individuals with hypochondriasis are now classified as having somatic symptom disorder; however, in a minority of cases, the diagnosis of illness anxiety disorder applies instead. Illness anxiety disorder entails a preoccupation with having or acquiring a serious, undiagnosed medical illness (Criterion A). Somatic symptoms are not present or, if present, are only mild in intensity (Criterion B). A thorough evaluation fails to identify a serious medical condition that accounts for the individual's concerns. While the concern may be derived from a nonpathological physical sign or sensation, the individual's distress emanates not primarily from the physical complaint itself but rather from his or her anxiety about the meaning, significance, or cause of the complaint (i. e. , the suspected medical diagnosis). If a physical sign or symptom is present, it is often a normal physiological sensation (e. g. , orthostatic dizziness), a benign and self-limited dysfunction (e. g. , transient tinnitus), or a bodily discomfort not generally considered indicative of disease (e. g. , belching). If a diagnosable medical condition is present, the individual's anxiety and preoccupation are clearly excessive and disproportionate to the severity of the condition (Criterion B). Empirical evidence and existing literature pertain to previously defined DSM hypochondriasis, and it is unclear to what extent and how precisely they apply to the description of this new diagnosis. The preoccupation with the idea that one is sick is accompanied by substantial anxiety about health and disease (Criterion C). Individuals with illness anxiety disorder are easily alarmed about illness, such as by hearing about someone else falling ill or reading a healthrelated news story. Their concerns about undiagnosed disease do not respond to appropriate medical reassurance, negative diagnostic tests, or benign course. The physician's attempts at reassurance and symptom palliation generally do not alleviate the individual's concerns and may heighten them. Illness concerns assume a prominent place in the individual's life, affecting daily activities, and may even result in invalidism. Illness becomes a central feature of the individual's identity and self-image, a frequent topic of social discourse, and a characteristic response to stressful life events. Individuals with the disorder often examine themselves repeatedly (e. g. , examining one's throat in the mirror) (Criterion D). They research their suspected disease excessively (e. g. , on the Internet) and repeatedly seek reassurance from family, friends, or physicians. This incessant worrying often becomes frustrating for others and may result in considerable strain within the family. In some cases, the anxiety leads to maladaptive avoidance of situations (e. g. , visiting sick family members) or activities (e. g. , exercise) that these individuals fear might jeopardize their health. Recording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis: Because they believe they are medically ill, individuals with illness anxiety disorder are encountered far more frequently in medical than in mental health settings. The majority of individuals with illness anxiety disorder have extensive yet unsatisfactory medical care, though some may be too anxious to seek medical attention. They generally have elevated rates of medical utilization but do not utilize mental health services more than the general population. They often consult multiple physicians for the same problem and obtain repeatedly negative diagnostic test results. At times, medical attention leads to a paradoxical exacerbation of anxiety or to iatrogenic complications from diagnostic tests and procedures. Individuals with the disorder are generally dissatisfied with their medical care and find it unhelpful, often feeling they are not being taken seriously by physicians. At times, these concerns may be justified, since physicians sometimes are dismissive or respond with frustration or hostility. This response can occasionally result in a failure to diagnose a medical condition that is present\nPrevalence: Prevalence estimates of illness anxiety disorder are based on estimates of the DSM-III and DSM-rV diagnosis hypochondriasis. The 1- to 2-year prevalence of health anxiety and/or disease conviction in community surveys and population-based samples ranges fiOm 1. 3% to 10%. In ambulatory medical populations, the 6-month/1-year prevalence rates are between 3% and 8%. The prevalence of the disorder is similar in males and females. Development And Course: The development and course of illness anxiety disorder are unclear. Illness anxiety disorder is generally thought to be a chronic and relapsing condition with an age at onset in early and middle adulthood. In population-based samples, health-related anxiety increases with age, but the ages of individuals with high health anxiety in medical settings do not appear to differ from those of other patients in those settings. In older individuals, health-related anxiety often focuses on memory loss; the disorder is thought to be rare in children. Risk And Prognostic Factors: Environmental. Illness anxiety disorder may sometimes be precipitated by a major life stress or a serious but ultimately benign threat to the individual's health. A history of child\u00ad hood abuse or of a serious childhood ilhiess may predispose to development of the disorder in adulthood^ Course modifiers. Approximately one-third to one-half of individuals with illness anxiety disorder have a transient form, which is associated with less psychiatric comorbidity, more medical comorbidity, and less severe illness aiixiety disorder. Culture Related Diagnostic Issues: The diagnosis should be made with caution in individuals whose ideas about disease are congruent with widely held, culturally sanctioned beliefs. Little is known about the phenomenology of the disorder across cultures, although the prevalence appears to be similar across different countries with diverse cultures. Gender Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nSuicide Risk:  \nFunctional Consequences: Illness anxiety disorder causes substantial role impairment and decrements in physical function and health-related quality of life. Health concerns often interfere with interpersonal relationships, disrupt family life, and damage occupational performance\nDiagnostic Markers:  \nDifferential Diagnosis: Other medical conditions. The first differential diagnostic consideration is an underlying medical condition, including neurological or endocrine conditions, occult malignancies, and other diseases that affect multiple body systems. The presence of a medical condition does not rule out the possibility of coexisting illness anxiety disorder. If a medical condition is present, the health-related anxiety and disease concerns are clearly disproportionate to its seriousness. Transient preoccupations related to a medical condition do not constitute illness anxiety disorder. Adjustment disorders. Health-related anxiety is a normal response to serious illness and is not a mental disorder. Such nonpathological health anxiety is clearly related to the medical condition and is typically time-limited. If the health anxiety is severe enough, an adjustment disorder may be diagnosed. However, only when the health anxiety is of sufficient duration, severity, and distress can illness anxiety disorder be diagnosed. Thus, the diagnosis requires the continuous persistence of disproportionate health-related anxiety for at least 6 months. Somatic symptom disorder. Somatic symptom disorder is diagnosed when significant somatic symptoms are present. In contrast, individuals with illness anxiety disorder have minimal somatic symptoms and are primarily concerned with the idea they are ill. Anxiety disorders. In generalized anxiety disorder, individuals worry about multiple events, situations, or activities, only one of which may involve health. In panic disorder, the individual may be concerned that the panic attacks reflect the presence of a medical illness; however, although these individuals may have health anxiety, their anxiety is typically very acute and episodic. In illness anxiety disorder, the health anxiety and fears are more persistent and enduring. Individuals with illness anxiety disorder may experience panic attacks that are triggered by their illness concerns. Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders. Individuals with illness anxiety disorder may have intrusive thoughts about having a disease and also may have associated compulsive behaviors (e. g. , seeking reassurance). However, in illness anxiety disorder, the preoccupations are usually focused on having a disease, whereas in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), the thoughts are intrusive and are usually focused on fears of getting a disease in the future. Most individuals with OCD have obsessions or compulsions involving other concerns in addition to fears about contracting disease. In body dysmorphic dis- order, concerns are limited to the individual's physical appearance, which is viewed as defective or flawed. Major depressive disorder. Some individuals with a major depressive episode ruminate about their health and worry excessively about illness. A separate diagnosis of illness anxiety disorder is not made if these concerns occur only during major depressive episodes. However, if excessive illness worry persists after remission of an episode of major depressive disorder, the diagnosis of illness anxiety disorder should be considered. Psychotic disorders. Individuals with illness anxiety disorder are not delusional and can acknowledge the possibility that the feared disease is not present. Their ideas do not attain the rigidity and intensity seen in the somatic delusions occurring in psychotic disorders (e. g. , schizophrenia; delusional disorder, somatic type; major depressive disorder, with psychotic features). True somatic delusions are generally more bizarre (e. g. , that an organ is rotting or dead) than the concerns seen in illness anxiety disorder. The concerns seen in illness anxiety disorder, though not founded in reality, are plausible. Comorbidity: Because illness anxiety disorder is a new disorder, exact comorbidities are unknown. Hypochondriasis co-occurs with anxiety disorders (in particular, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and OCD) and depressive disorders. Approximately two-thirds of individuals with illness anxiety disorder are likely to have at least one other comorbid major mental disorder. Individuals with illness anxiety disorder may have an elevated risk for somatic symptom disorder and personality disorders. Relationship To Other Classifications:.", "Disorder: Conversion Disorder (Functional Neurological Symptom Disorder)\nICD-9: 300. 11, ICD-10: Variable\nNotes: \nDiagnostic Criteria:\n  A: One or more symptoms of altered voluntary motor or sensory function. B: Clinical findings provide evidence of incompatibility between the symptom and recognized neurological or medical conditions. C: The symptom or deficit is not better explained by another medical or mental disorder\n  D: The symptom or deficit causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning or warrants medical evaluation. Disorder Id: 85\nDiagnostic Features: Many clinicians use the alternative names of \"functional\" (referring to abnormal central nervous system functioning) or \"psychogenic\" (referring to an assumed etiology) to describe the symptoms of conversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder). In conversion disorder, there may be one or more symptoms of various types. Motor symptoms include weakness or paralysis; abnormal movements, such as tremor or dystonie movements; gait abnormalities; and abnormal limb posturing. Sensory symptoms include altered, reduced, or absent skin sensation, vision, or hearing. Episodes of abnormal generalized limb shaking with apparent impaired or loss of consciousness may resemble epileptic seizures (also called psychogenic or non-epileptic seizures). There may be episodes of unresponsiveness resembling syncope or coma. Other symptoms include reduced or absent speech volume (dysphonia/aphonia), altered articulation (dysarthria), a sensation of a lump in the throat (globus), and diplopia. Although the diagnosis requires that the symptom is not explained by neurological disease, it should not be made simply because results from investigations are normal or because the symptom is \"bizarre. \" There must be clinical findings that show clear evidence of incompatibility with neurological disease. Internal inconsistency at examination is one way to demonstrate incompatibility (i. e. , demonstrating that physical signs elicited through one examination method are no longer positive when tested a different way). Examples of such examination findings include \u2022 Hoover's sign, in which weakness of hip extension returns to normal strength with contralateral hip flexion against resistance. \u2022 Marked weakness of ankle plantar-flexion when tested on the bed in an individual who is able to walk on tiptoes; \u2022 Positive findings on the tremor entrainment test. On this test, a unilateral tremor may be identified as functional if the tremor changes when the individual is distracted away from it. This may be observed if the individual is asked to copy the examiner in making a rhythmical movement with their unaffected hand and this causes the functional tremor to change such that it copies or \"entrains\" to the rhythm of the unaffected hand or the functional tremor is suppressed, or no longer makes a simple rhythmical movement. \u2022 In attacks resembling epilepsy or syncope (\"psychogenic\" non-epileptic attacks), the occurrence of closed eyes with resistance to opening or a normal simultaneous electroencephalogram (although this alone does not exclude all forms of epilepsy or syncope). \u2022 For visual symptoms, a tubular visual field (i. e. , tunnel vision). It is important to note that the diagnosis of conversion disorder should be based on the overall clinical picture and not on a single clinical finding. Recording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis: A number of associated features can support the diagnosis of conversion disorder. There may be a history of multiple similar somatic symptoms. Onset may be associated with stress or trauma, either psychological or physical in nature. The potential etiological rele\u00ad vance of this stress or trauma may be suggested by a close temporal relationship. However, while assessment for stress and trauma is important, the diagnosis should not be withheld if none is found. Conversion disorder is often associated with dissociative symptoms, such as depersonalization, derealization, and dissociative amnesia, particularly at symptom onset or during attacks. The diagnosis of conversion disorder does not require the judgment that the symptoms are not intentionally produced (i. e. , not feigned), as the definite absence of feigning may not be reliably discerned. The phenomenon of la belle indiff\u00e9rence (i. e. , lack of concern about the nature or implications of the symptom) has been associated with conversion disorder but it is not specific for conversion disorder and should not be used to make the diagnosis. Similarly the concept of secondary gain (i. e. , when individuals derive external benefits such as money or release from responsibilities) is also not specific to conversion disorder and particularly in the context of definite evidence for feigning, the diagnoses that should be considered instead would include factitious disorder or malingering (see the section \"Differential Diagnosis\" for this disorder). Prevalence: Transient conversion symptoms are common, but the precise prevalence of the disorder is unknown. This is partly because the diagnosis usually requires assessment in secondary care, where it is found in approximately 5% of referrals to neurology clinics. The incidence of individual persistent conversion symptoms is estimated to be 2-5/100,000 per year\nDevelopment And Course: Onset has been reported throughout the life course. The onset of non-epileptic attacks peaks in the third decade, and motor symptoms have their peak onset in the fourth decade. The symptoms can be transient or persistent. The prognosis may be better in younger children than in adolescents and adults. Risk And Prognostic Factors: Temperamental. Maladaptive personality traits are commonly associated with conversion disorder. Environmental. There may be a history of childhood abuse and neglect. Stressful life events are often, but not always, present. Genetic and physiological. The presence of neurological disease that causes similar symptoms is a risk factor (e. g. , non-epileptic seizures are more common in patients who also have epilepsy). Course modifiers. Short duration of symptoms and acceptance of the diagnosis are positive prognostic factors. Maladaptive personality traits, the presence of comorbid physical disease, and the receipt of disability benefits may be negative prognostic factors. Culture Related Diagnostic Issues: Changes resembling conversion (and dissociative) symptoms are common in certain culturally sanctioned rituals. If the symptoms are fully explained within the particular cultural context and do not result in clinically significant distress or disability, then the diagnosis of conversion disorder is not made. Gender Related Diagnostic Issues: Conversion disorder is two to three times more common in females\nSuicide Risk:  \nFunctional Consequences: Individuals with conversion symptoms may have substantial disability. The severity of disability can be similar to that experienced by individuals with comparable medical diseases. Diagnostic Markers:  \nDifferential Diagnosis: If another mental disorder better explains the symptoms, that diagnosis should be made. However the diagnosis of conversion disorder may be made in the presence of another mental disorder. Neurological disease. The main differential diagnosis is neurological disease that might better explain the symptoms. After a thorough neurological assessment, an unexpected neurological disease cause for the symptoms is rarely found at follow up. However, reassessment may be required if the symptoms appear to be progressive. Conversion disorder may coexist with neurological disease. Somatic symptom disorder. Conversion disorder may be diagnosed in addition to somatic symptom disorder. Most of the somatic symptoms encountered in somatic symptom disorder cannot be demonstrated to be clearly incompatible with pathophysiology (e. g. , pain, fatigue), whereas in conversion disorder, such incompatibility is required for the diagnosis. The excessive thoughts, feelings, and behaviors characterizing somatic symptom disorder are often absent in conversion disorder. Factitious disorder and malingering. The diagnosis of conversion disorder does not require the judgment that the symptoms are not intentionally produced (i. e. , not feigned), because assessment of conscious intention is unreliable. However definite evidence of feigning (e. g. , clear evidence that loss of function is present during the examination but not at home) would suggest a diagnosis of factitious disorder if the individual's apparent aim is to assume the sick role or malingering if the aim is to obtain an incentive such as money. Dissociative disorders. Dissociative symptoms are common in individuals with conversion disorder. If both conversion disorder and a dissociative disorder are present, both diagnoses should be made. Body dysmorphic disorder. Individuals with body dysmorphic disorder are excessively concerned about a perceived defect in their physical features but do not complain of symptoms of sensory or motor functioning in the affected body part. Depressive disorders. In depressive disorders, individuals may report general heaviness of their limbs, whereas the weakness of conversion disorder is more focal and prominent. Depressive disorders are also differentiated by the presence of core depressive symptoms. Panic disorder. Episodic neurological symptoms (e. g. , tremors and paresthesias) can occur in both conversion disorder and panic attacks. In panic attacks, the neurological symptoms are typically transient and acutely episodic with characteristic cardiorespiratory symptoms. Loss of awareness with amnesia for the attack and violent limb movements occur in non-epileptic attacks, but not in panic attacks. Comorbidity: Anxiety disorders, especially panic disorder, and depressive disorders commonly co-occur with conversion disorder. Somatic symptom disorder may co-occur as well. Psychosis, substance use disorder, and alcohol misuse are uncommon. Personality disorders are more common in individuals with conversion disorder than in the general population. Neurological or other medical conditions commonly coexist with conversion disorder as well.

These factors can adversely affect the medical condition by influencing its course or treatment, by constituting an additional well-established health risk factor, or by influencing the underlying pathophysiology to precipitate or exacerbate symptoms or to necessitate medical attention. Psychological or behavioral factors include psychological distress, patterns of interpersonal interaction, coping styles, and maladaptive health behaviors, such as denial of symptoms or poor adherence to medical recommendations. Common clinical examples are anxiety-exacerbating asthma, denial of need for treatment for acute chest pain, and manipulation of insulin by an individual v^ith diabetes wishing to lose weight. Many different psychological factors have been demonstrated to adversely influence medical conditions\u2014 for example, symptoms of depression or anxiety, stressful life events, relationship style, personality traits, and coping styles. The adverse effects can range from acute, with immediate medical consequences (e. g. , Takotsubo cardiomyopathy) to chronic, occurring over a long period of time (e. g. , chronic occupational stress increasing risk for hypertension). Affected medical conditions can be those with clear pathophysiology (e. g. , diabetes, cancer, coronary disease), functional syndromes (e. g. , migraine, irritable bowel syndrome, fibromyalgia), or idiopathic medical symptoms (e. g. , pain, fatigue, dizziness). This diagnosis should be reserved for situations in which the effect of the psychological factor on the medical condition is evident and the psychological factor has clinically significant effects on the course or outcome of the medical condition. Abnormal psychological or behavioral symptoms that develop in response to a medical condition are more properly coded as an adjustment disorder (a clinically significant psychological response to an identifiable stressor). There must be reasonable evidence to suggest an association between the psychological factors and the medical condition, although it may often not be possible to demonstrate direct causality or the mechanisms underlying the relationship. Recording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis:  \nPrevalence: The prevalence of psychological factors affecting other medical conditions is unclear. In U. S. private insurance billing data, it is a more common diagnosis than somatic symptom disorders. Development And Course: Psychological factors affecting other medical conditions can occur across the lifespan. Particularly with young children, corroborative history from parents or school can assist the diagnostic evaluation. Some conditions are characteristic of particular life stages (e. g. , in older individuals, the stress associated with acting as a caregiver for an ill spouse or partner)\nRisk And Prognostic Factors:  \nCulture Related Diagnostic Issues: Many differences between cultures may influence psychological factors and their effects on medical conditions, such as those in language and communication style, explanatory models of illness, patterns of seeking health care, service availability and organization, doctor-patient relationships and other healing practices, family and gender roles, and attitudes toward pain and death. Psychological factors affecting other medical conditions must be differentiated from culturally specific behaviors such as using faith or spiritual healers or other variations in illness management that are acceptable within a culture and represent an attempt to help the medical condition rather than interfere with it. These local practices may complement rather than obstruct evidence-based interventions. If they do not adversely affect outcomes, they should not be pathologized as psychological factors affecting other medical conditions\nGender Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nSuicide Risk:  \nFunctional Consequences: Psychological and behavioral factors have been demonstrated to affect the course of many medical diseases. Diagnostic Markers:  \nDifferential Diagnosis: Mental disorder due to another medical condition. A temporal association between symptoms of a mental disorder and those of a medical condition is also characteristic of a mental disorder due to another medical condition, but the presumed causality is in the opposite direction. In a mental disorder due to another medical condition, the medical condition is judged to be causing the mental disorder through a direct physiological mechanism. In psychological factors affecting other medical conditions, the psychological or behavioral factors are judged to affect the course of the medical condition. Adjustment disorders. Abnormal psychological or behavioral symptoms that develop in response to a medical condition are more properly coded as an adjustment disorder (a clinically significant psychological response to an identifiable stressor). For example, an indi\u00ad vidual with angina that is precipitated whenever he becomes enraged would be diagnosed as having psychological factors affecting other medical conditions, whereas an individual with angina who developed maladaptive anticipatory anxiety would be diagnosed as having an adjustment disorder with anxiety. In clinical practice, however, psychological factors and a medical condition are often mutually exacerbating (e. g. , anxiety as both a precipitant and a consequence of angina), in which case the distinction is arbitrary. Other mental disorders frequently result in medical complications, most notably substance use disorders (e. g. , alcohol use disorder, tobacco use disorder). If an individual has a coexisting major mental disorder that adversely affects or causes another medical condition, diagnoses of the mental disorder and the medical condition are usually sufficient. Psychological factors affecting other medical conditions is diagnosed when the psychological traits or behaviors do not meet criteria for a mental diagnosis. Somatic symptom disorder. Somatic symptom disorder is characterized by a combination of distressing somatic symptoms and excessive or maladaptive thoughts, feelings, and behavior in response to these symptoms or associated health concerns. The individual may or may not have a diagnosable medical condition. In contrast, in psychological factors affecting other medical conditions, the psychological factors adversely affect a medical condition; the individual's thoughts, feelings, and behavior are not necessarily excessive. The difference is one of emphasis, rather than a clear-cut distinction. In psychological factors affecting other medical conditions, the emphasis is on the exacerbation of the medical condition (e. g. , an individual with angina that is precipitated whenever he becomes anxious). In somatic symptom disorder, the emphasis is on maladaptive thoughts, feelings, and behavior (e. g. , an individual with angina who worries constantly that she will have a heart attack, takes her blood pressure multiple times per day, and restricts her activities). Illness anxiety disorder. Illness anxiety disorder is characterized by high illness anxiety that is distressing and/or disruptive to daily life with minimal somatic symptoms. The focus of clinical concern is the individual's worry about having a disease; in most cases, no serious disease is present. In psychological factors affecting other medical conditions, anxiety may be a relevant psychological factor affecting a medical condition, but the clinical concern is the adverse effects on the medical condition. Comorbidity: By definition, the diagnosis of psychological factors affecting other medical conditions entails a relevant psychological or behavioral syndrome or trait and a comorbid medical condition\nRelationship To Other Classifications:.", "Disorder: Factitious Disorder\nICD-9: 300. 19, ICD-10: F68. 10\nNotes: \nDiagnostic Criteria:\n  Factitious Disorder Imposed on Self: \n    - {'dccd_id': '329', 'dcc_id': '345', 'parent_dccd_id': '0', 'dccd_key': 'A', 'dccd_value': 'Falsification of physical or psychological signs or symptoms, or induction of injury or disease, associated with identified deception.

Individuals with factitious disorder can also seek treatment for themselves or another following induction of injury or disease. The diagnosis requires demonstrating that the individual is taking surreptitious actions to misrepresent, simulate, or cause signs or symptoms of illness or injury in the absence of obvious external rewards. Methods of illness falsification can include exaggeration, fabrication, simulation, and induction. While a preexisting medical condition may be present, the deceptive behavior or induction of injury associated with deception causes others to view such individuals (or another) as more ill or impaired, and this can lead to excessive clinical intervention. Individuals with factitious disorder might, for example, report feelings of depression and suicidality following the death of a spouse despite the death not being true or the individual's not having a spouse; deceptively report episodes of neurological symptoms (e. g. , seizures, dizziness, or blacking out); manipulate a laboratory test (e. g. , by adding blood to urine) to falsely indicate an abnormality; falsify medical records to indicate an illness; ingest a substance (e. g. , insulin or warfarin) to induce an abnormal laboratory result or illness; or physically injure themselves or induce illness in themselves or anotiier (e. g. , by injecting fecal material to produce an abscess or to induce sepsis). Recording Procedures: When an individual falsifies illness in another (e. g. , children, adults, pets), the diagnosis is factitious disorder imposed on another. The perpetrator, not the victim, is given the diagnosis. The victim may be given an abuse diagnosis (e. g. , 995. 54 [T74. 12X]; see the chapter 'Other Conditions That May Be a Focus of Clinical Attention\"). Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis: Individuals with factitious disorder imposed on self or factitious disorder imposed on another are at risk for experiencing great psychological distress or functional impairment by causing harm to themselves and others. Family, friends, and health care professionals are also often adversely affected by their behavior. Factitious disorders have similarities to substance use disorders, eating disorders, impulse-control disorders, pedophilic disorder, and some other established disorders related to both the persistence of the behavior and the intentional efforts to conceal the disordered behavior through deception. Whereas some aspects of factitious disorders might represent criminal behavior (e. g. , factitious dis- order imposed on another, in which the parent's actions represent abuse and maltreatment of a child), such criminal behavior and mental illness are not mutually exclusive. The diagnosis of factitious disorder emphasizes the objective identification of falsification of signs and symptoms of illness, rather than an inference about intent or possible underlying motivation. Moreover, such behaviors, including the induction of injury or disease, are associated with deception. Prevalence: The prevalence of factitious disorder is unknown, likely because of the role of deception in this population. Among patients in hospital settings, it is estimated that about 1% of individuals have presentations that meet the criteria for factitious disorder\nDevelopment And Course: The course of factitious disorder is usually one of intermittent episodes. Single episodes and episodes that are characterized as persistent and unremitting are both less common. Onset is usually in early adulthood, often after hospitalization for a medical condition or a mental disorder. When imposed on another, the disorder may begin after hospitalization of the individual's child or other dependent. In individuals with recurrent episodes of falsification of signs and symptoms of illness and/or induction of injury, this pattern of successive deceptive contact with medical personnel, including hospitalizations, may become lifelong. Risk And Prognostic Factors:  \nCulture Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nGender Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nSuicide Risk:  \nFunctional Consequences:  \nDiagnostic Markers:  \nDifferential Diagnosis: Caregivers who lie about abuse injuries in dependents solely to protect themselves from liability are not diagnosed with factitious disorder imposed on anotiier because protection from liability is an external reward (Criterion C, the deceptive behavior is evident even in the absence of obvious external rewards). Such caregivers who, upon observation, analysis of medical records, and/or interviews with others, are found to lie more extensively than needed for immediate self-protection are diagnosed with factitious disorder imposed on another. Somatic symptom disorder. In somatic symptom disorder, there may be excessive attention and treatment seeking for perceived medical concerns, but there is no evidence that the individual is providing false information or behaving deceptively. Malingering. Malingering is differentiated from factitious disorder by the intentional reporting of symptoms for personal gain (e. g. , money, time off work). In contrast, the diagnosis of factitious disorder requires the absence of obvious rewards. Conversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder). Conversion disorder is characterized by neurological symptoms that are inconsistent with neurological pathophysiology. Factitious disorder with neurological symptoms is distinguished from conversion disorder by evidence of deceptive falsification of symptoms. Borderiine personality disorder. Deliberate physical self-harm in the absence of suicidal intent can also occur in association with other mental disorders such as borderline personality disorder. Factitious disorder requires that the induction of injury occur in association with deception. Medical condition or mental disorder not associated with intentional symptom falsification. Presentation of signs and symptoms of illness that do not conform to an identifiable medical condition or mental disorder increases the likelihood of the presence of a factitious disorder. However, the diagnosis of factitious disorder does not exclude the presence of true medical condition or mental disorder, as comorbid illness often occurs in the individual along with factitious disorder. For example, individuals who might manipulate blood sugar levels to produce symptoms may also have diabetes.

Typical substances ingested tend to vary with age and availability and might include paper, soap, cloth, hair, string, wool, soil, chalk, talcum powder, paint, gum, metal, pebbles, charcoal or coal, ash, clay, starch, or ice. The term nonfood is included because the diagnosis of pica does not apply to ingestion of diet products that have minimal nutritional content. There is typically no aversion to food in general. The eating of nonnutritive, nonfood substances must be developmentally inappropriate (Criterion B) and not part of a culturally supported or socially normative practice (Criterion C). A minimum age of 2 years is suggested for a pica diagnosis to exclude developmentally normal mouthing of objects by infants that results in ingestion. The eating of nonnutritive, nonfood substances can be an associated feature of other mental disorders (e. g. , intellectual disability [intellectual developmental disorder], autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia). If the eating behavior occurs exclusively in the context of another mental disorder, a separate diagnosis of pica should be made only if the eating behavior is sufficientiy severe to warrant additional clinical attention (Criterion D). Recording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis: Although deficiencies in vitamins or minerals (e. g. , zinc, iron) have been reported in some instances, often no specific biological abnormalities are found. In some cases, pica comes to clinical attention only following general medical complications (e. g. , mechanical bowel problems; intestinal obstruction, such as that resulting from a bezoar; intestinal perforation; infections such as toxoplasmosis and toxocariasis as a result of ingesting feces or dirt; poisoning, such as by ingestion of lead-based paint). Prevalence: The prevalence of pica is unclear. Among individuals with intellectual disability, the prevalence of pica appears to increase with the severity of the condition,\nDevelopment And Course: Onset of pica can occur in childhood, adolescence, or adulthood, although childhood onset is most commonly reported. Pica can occur in otherwise normally developing children, whereas in adults, it appears more likely to occur in the context of intellectual disability or other mental disorders. The eating of nonnutritive, nonfood substances may also manifest in pregnancy, when specific cravings (e. g. , chalk or ice) might occur. The diagnosis of pica during pregnancy is only appropriate if such cravings lead to the ingestion of nonnutritive, nonfood substances to the extent that the eating of these substances poses potential medical risks. The course of the disorder can be protracted and can result in medical emergencies (e. g. , intestinal obstruction, acute weight loss, poisoning). The disorder can potentially be fatal depending on substances ingested. Risk And Prognostic Factors: Environmental. Neglect, lack of supervision, and developmental delay can increase the risk for this condition. Culture Related Diagnostic Issues: In some populations, the eating of earth or other seemingly nonnutritive substances is believed to be of spiritual, medicinal, or other social value, or may be a culturally supported or socially normative practice. Such behavior does not warrant a diagnosis of pica (Criterion C)\nGender Related Diagnostic Issues: Pica occurs in both males and females. It can occur in females during pregnancy; however, little is known about the course of pica in the postpartum period. Suicide Risk:  \nFunctional Consequences: Pica can significantly impair physical functioning, but it is rarely the sole cause of impairment in social functioning. Pica often occurs with other disorders associated with impaired social functioning. Diagnostic Markers: Abdominal flat plate radiography, ultrasound, and other scanning methods may reveal obstructions related to pica. Blood tests and other laboratory tests can be used to ascertain levels of poisoning or the nature of infection. Differential Diagnosis: Eating of nonnutritive, nonfood substances may occur during the course of other mental disorders (e. g. , autism spectrum disorder, schizophrenia) and in Kleine-Levin syndrome. In any such instance, an additional diagnosis of pica should be given only if the eating behavior is sufficiently persistent and severe to warrant additional clinical attention. Anorexia nervosa. Pica can usually be distinguished from the other feeding and eating disorders by the consumption of nonnutritive, nonfood substances. It is important to note, however, that some presentations of anorexia nervosa include ingestion of nonnutritive, nonfood substances, such as paper tissues, as a means of attempting to control appetite. In such cases, when the eating of nonnutritive, nonfood substances is primarily used as a means of weight control, anorexia nervosa should be the primary diagnosis. Factitious disorder. Some individuals with factitious disorder may intentionally ingest foreign objects as part of the pattern of falsification of physical symptoms. In such instances, there is an element of deception that is consistent with deliberate induction of injury or disease. Nonsuicidal self-injury and nonsuicidal self-injury behaviors in personality disorders. Some individuals may swallow potentially harmful items (e. g. , pins, needles, knives) in the context of maladaptive behavior patterns associated with personality disorders or nonsuicidal self-injury. Comorbidity: Disorders most commonly comorbid with pica are autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder), and, to a lesser degree, schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Pica can be associated with trichotillomania (hairpulling disorder) and excoriation (skin-picking) disorder. In comorbid presentations, the hair or skin is typically ingested. Pica can also be associated with avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder, particularly in individuals with a strong sensory component to their presentation. When an individual is known to have pica, assessment should include consideration of the possibility of gastrointestinal complications, poisoning, infection, and nutritional deficiency\nRelationship To Other Classifications:  \nAge range: {'pmo_id': '111', 'property_value': 'Children', 'icd_9_override': '307. 52', 'icd_10_override': 'F98. 3'}, {'pmo_id': '112', 'property_value': 'Adults', 'icd_9_override': '307. 52', 'icd_10_override': 'F50. 8'}.", "Disorder: Rumination Disorder\nICD-9: 307. 53, ICD-10: F98. 21\nNotes: \nDiagnostic Criteria:\n  A: Repeated regurgitation of food over a period of at least 1 month. Regurgitated food may be re-chewed, re-swallowed, or spit out\n  B: The repeated regurgitation is not attributable to an associated gastrointestinal or other medical condition (e. g. , gastroesophageal reflux, pyloric stenosis). C: The eating disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge-eating disorder, or avoidant/restrictive food intal\n  D: If the symptoms occur in the context of another mental disorder (e. g. , intellectual disability [Intellectual developmental disorder] or another neurodevelopmental disorder), they are sufficiently severe to warrant additional clinical attention\nDisorder Id: 91\nDiagnostic Features: The essential feature of rumination disorder is the repeated regurgitation of food occurring after feeding or eating over a period of at least 1 month (Criterion A). Previously swallowed food that may be partially digested is brought up into the mouth without apparent nausea, involuntary retching, or disgust. The food may be re-chewed and then ejected from the mouth or re-swallowed. Regurgitation in rumination disorder should be frequent, occurring at least several times per week, typically daily. The behavior is not better explained by an associated gastrointestinal or other medical condition (e. g. , gastroesophageal reflux, pyloric stenosis) (Criterion B) and does not occur exclusively during the course of anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge-eating disorder, or avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (Criterion C). If the symptoms occur in the context of another mental disorder (e. g. , intellectual disability [intellectual developmental disorder], neurodevelopmental disorder), they must be sufficiently severe to warrant additional clinical attention (Criterion D) and should represent a primary aspect of the individual's presentation requiring intervention. The disorder may be diagnosed across the life span, particularly in individuals who also have intellectual disability. Many individuals with rumination disorder can be directly observed engaging in the behavior by the clinician. In other instances diagnosis can be made on the basis of self-report or corroborative information from parents or caregivers. Individuals may describe the behavior as habitual or outside of their control. Recording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis: Infants with rumination disorder display a characteristic position of straining and arching the back with the head held back, making sucking movements with their tongue. They may give the impression of gaining satisfaction from the activity. They may be irritable and hungry between episodes of regurgitation. Weight loss and failure to make expected weight gains are common features in infants with rumination disorder. Malnutrition may occur despite the infant's apparent hunger and the ingestion of relatively large amounts of food, particularly in severe cases, when regurgitation immediately follows each feeding episode and regurgitated food is expelled. Malnutrition might also occur in older children and adults, particularly when the regurgitation is accompanied by restriction of intake. Adolescents and adults may attempt to disguise the regurgitation behavior by placing a hand over the mouth or coughing. Some will avoid eating with others because of the acknowledged soqal undesirability of the behavior. This may extend to an avoidance of eating prior to social situations, such as work or school (e. g. , avoiding breakfast because it may be followed by regurgitation)\nPrevalence: Prevalence data for rumination disorder are inconclusive, but the disorder is commonly reported to be higher in certain groups, such as individuals with intellectual disability\nDevelopment And Course: Onset of rumination disorder can occur in infancy, childhood, adolescence, or adulthood. The age at onset in infants is usually between ages 3 and 12 months. In infants, the disorder frequently remits spontaneously, but its course can be protracted and can result in medical emergencies (e. g. , severe malnutrition). It can potentially be fatal, particularly in infancy. Rumination disorder can have an episodic course or occur continuously until treated. In infants, as well as in older individuals with intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder) or other neurodevelopmental disorders, the regurgitation and rumination behavior appears to have a self-soothing or self-stimulating function, similar to that of other repetitive motor behaviors such as head banging\nRisk And Prognostic Factors: Environmental. Psychosocial problems such as lack of stimulation, neglect, stressful life situations, and problems in the parent-child relationship may be predisposing factors in infants and young children\nCulture Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nGender Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nSuicide Risk:  \nFunctional Consequences: Malnutrition secondary to repeated regurgitation may be associated with growth delay and have a negative effect on development and learning potential. Some older individuals with rumination disorder deliberately restrict their food intake because of the social undesirability of regurgitation. They may therefore present with weight loss or low weight. In older children, adolescents, and adults, social functioning is more likely to be adversely affected. Diagnostic Markers:  \nDifferential Diagnosis: Gastrointestinal conditions. It is important to differentiate regurgitation in rumination disorder from other conditions characterized by gastroesophageal reflux or vomiting. Conditions such as gastroparesis, pyloric stenosis, hiatal hernia, and Sandifer syndrome in infants should be ruled out by appropriate physical examinations and laboratory tests. Anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. Individuals with anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa may also engage in regurgitation with subsequent spitting out of food as a means of disposing of ingested calories because of concerns about weight gain. Comorbidity: Regurgitation with associated rumination can occur in the context of a concurrent medical condition or another mental disorder (e. g. , generalized anxiety disorder). When the regurgitation occurs in this context, a diagnosis of rumination disorder is appropriate only when the severity of the disturbance exceeds that routinely associated with such conditions or disorders and warrants additional clinical attention\nRelationship To Other Classifications:.", "Disorder: Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder\nICD-9: 307. 59, ICD-10: F50. 8\nNotes: \nDiagnostic Criteria:\n  A: An eating or feeding disturbance (e. g. , apparent lack of interest in eating or food; avoidance based on tlie sensory ciiaracteristics of food; concern about aversive consequences of eating) as manifested by persistent failure to meet appropriate nutritional and/or energy needs associated with one (or more) of the following:\n    - {'dccd_id': '337', 'dcc_id': '359', 'parent_dccd_id': '0', 'dccd_key': '1', 'dccd_value': 'Significant weight loss (or failure to achieve expected weight gain or faltering growth in children)'}\n    - {'dccd_id': '338', 'dcc_id': '359', 'parent_dccd_id': '0', 'dccd_key': '2', 'dccd_value': 'Significant nutritional deficiency.

When the eating disturbance occurs in the context of another condition or disorder, the severity of the eating disturbance exceeds that routinely associated with the condition or disorder and warrants additional clinical attention\nDisorder Id: 92\nDiagnostic Features: Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder replaces and extends the DSM-IV diagnosis of feeding disorder of infancy or early childhood. The main diagnostic feature of avoidant/ restrictive food intake disorder is avoidance or restriction of food intake (Criterion A) manifested by clinically significant failure to meet requirements for nutrition or insufficient energy intake through oral intake of food. One or more of the following key features must be present: significant weight loss, significant nutritional deficiency (or related health impact), dependence on enteral feeding or oral nutritional supplements, or marked interference with psychosocial functioning. The determination of whether weight loss is significant (Criterion Al) is a clinical judgment; instead of losing weight, children and adolescents who have not completed growth may not maintain weight or height increases along their developmental trajectory. Determination of significant nutritional deficiency (Criterion A2) is also based on clinical assessment (e. g. , assessment of dietary intake, physical examination, and laboratory testing), and related impact on physical health can be of a similar severity to that seen in anorexia nervosa (e. g. , hypothermia, bradycardia, anemia). In severe cases, particularly in infants, malnutrition can be life threatening. \"Dependence\" on enteral feeding or oral nutritional supplements (Criterion A3) means that supplementary feeding is required to sustain adequate intake. Examples of individuals requiring supplementary feeding include infants with failure to thrive who require nasogastric tube feeding, children with neurodevelopmental disorders who are dependent on nutritionally complete supplements, and individuals who rely on gastrostomy tube feeding or complete oral nutrition supplements in the absence of an underlying medical condition. Inability to participate in normal social activities, such as eating with others, or to sustain relationships as a result of the disturbance would inculcate marked interference with psychosocial functioning (Criterion A4). Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder does not include avoidance or restriction of food intake related to lack of availability of food or to cultural practices (e. g. , religious fasting or normal dieting) (Criterion B), nor does it include developmentally normal behaviors (e. g. , picky eating in toddlers, reduced intake in older adults). The disturbance is not better explained by excessive concern about body weight or shape (Criterion C) or by concurrent medical factors or mental disorders (Criterion D). In some individuals, food avoidance or restriction may be based on the sensory characteristics of qualities of food, such as extreme sensitivity to appearance, color, smell, texture, temperature, or taste. Such behavior has been described as \"restrictive eating,\" \"selective eating,\" \"choosy eating,\" \"perseverant eating,\" \"chronic food refusal,\" and \"food neophobia\" and may manifest as refusal to eat particular brands of foods or to tolerate the smell of food being eaten by others. Individuals with heightened sensory sensitivities associated with autism may show similar behaviors. Food avoidance or restriction may also represent a conditioned negative response associated with food intake following, or in anticipation of, an aversive experience, such as choking; a traumatic investigation, usually involving the gastrointestinal tract (e. g. , esophagoscopy); or repeated vomiting. The terms frinctional dysphagia and globus hystericus have also been used for such conditions\nRecording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis: Several features may be associated with food avoidance or reduced food intake, including a lack of interest in eating or food, leading to weight loss or faltering growth. Very young infants may present as being too sleepy, distressed, or agitated to feed. Infants and young children may not engage with the primary caregiver during feeding or communicate hunger in favor of other activities. In older children and adolescents, food avoidance or restriction may be associated with more generalized emotional difficulties that do not meet diagnostic criteria for an anxiety, depressive, or bipolar disorder, sometimes called \"food avoidance emotional disorder. \"\nPrevalence:  \nDevelopment And Course: Food avoidance or restriction associated with insufficient intake or lack of interest in eating most commonly develops in infancy or early childhood and may persist in adulthood. Likewise, avoidance based on sensory characteristics of food tends to arise in the first decade of life but may persist into adulthood. Avoidance related to aversive consequences can arise at any age. The scant literature regarding long-term outcomes suggests that food avoidance or restriction based on sensory aspects is relatively stable and long-standing, but when persisting into adulthood, such avoidance/restriction can be associated with relatively normal functioning. There is currently insufficient evidence directly linking avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder and subsequent onset of an eating disorder. Infants with avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder may be irritable and difficult to console during feeding, or may appear apathetic and withdrawn. In some instances, parent-child interaction may contribute to the infant's feeding problem (e. g. , presenting food inappropriately, or interpreting the infant's behavior as an act of aggression or rejection). Inadequate nutritional intake may exacerbate the associated features (e. g. , irritability, developmental lags) and further contribute to feeding difficulties. Associated factors include infant temperament or developmental impairments that reduce an infant's responsiveness to feeding. Coexisting parental psychopathology, or child abuse or neglect, is suggested if feeding and weight improve in response to changing caregivers. In infants, children, and prepubertal adolescents, avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder may be associated with growth delay, and the resulting malnutrition negatively affects development and learning potential. In older children, adolescents, and adults, social functioning tends to be adversely affected. Regardless of the age, family function may be affected, with heightened stress at mealtimes and in other feeding or eating contexts involving friends and relatives. Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder manifests more commonly in children than in adults, and there may be a long delay between onset and clinical presentation. Triggers for presentation vary considerably and include physical, social, and emotional difficulties. Risk And Prognostic Factors: Temperamental. Anxiety disorders, autism spectrum disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder may increase risk for avoidant or restrictive feeding or eating behavior characteristic of the disorder. Environmental. Environmental risk factors for avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder include familial anxiety. Higher rates of feeding disturbances may occur in children of mothers with eating disorders. Genetic and physiological. History of gastrointestinal conditions, gastroesophageal reflux disease, vomiting, and a range of other medical problems has been associated with feeding and eating behaviors characteristic of avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder\nCulture Related Diagnostic Issues: Presentations similar to avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder occur in various populations, including in the United States, Canada, Australia, and Europe. Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder should not be diagnosed when avoidance of food intake is solely related to specific religious or cultural practices. Gender Related Diagnostic Issues: Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder is equally common in males and females in infancy and early childhood, but avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder comorbid with autism spectrum disorder has a male predominance. Food avoidance or restriction related to altered sensory sensitivities can occur in some physiological conditions, most notably pregnancy, but is not usually extreme and does not meet full criteria for the disorder. Suicide Risk:  \nFunctional Consequences: Associated developmental and functional limitations include impairment of physical development and social difficulties that can have a significant negative impact on family function\nDiagnostic Markers: Diagnostic markers include malnutrition, low weight, growth delay, and the need for artificial nutrition in the absence of any clear medical condition other than poor intake. Differential Diagnosis: Appetite loss preceding restricted intake is a nonspecific symptom that can accompany a number of mental diagnoses. Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder can be diagnosed concurrently with the disorders below if all criteria are met, and the eating disturbance requires specific clinical attention. Other medical conditions (e. g. , gastrointestinal disease, food allergies and Intolerances, occult malignancies). Restriction of food intake may occur in other medical condi- tiens, especially those with ongoing symptoms such as vomiting, loss of appetite, nausea, abdominal pain, o^ diarrhea. A diagnosis of avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder requires that the disturbance of intake is beyond that directly accounted for by physical symptoms consistent with a medical condition; tiie eating disturbance may also persist after being triggered by a medical condition and following resolution of the medical condition. Underlying medical or comorbid mental conditions may complicate feeding and eating. Because older individuals, postsurgical patients, and individuals receiving chemotherapy often lose their appetite, an additional diagnosis of avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder requires that the eating disturbance is a primary focus for intervention. Specific neurological/neuromuscular, structural, or congenital disorders and conditions associated with feeding difficulties. Feeding difficulties are common in a number of congenital and neurological conditions often related to problems with oral/esophageal/ pharyngeal structure and function, such as hypotonia of musculature, tongue protrusion, and unsafe swallowing. Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder can be diagnosed in individuals with such presentations as long as all diagnostic criteria are met. Reactive attachment disorder. Some degree of withdrawal is characteristic of reactive attachment disorder and can lead to a disturbance in the caregiver-child relationship that can affect feeding and the child's intake. Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder should be diagnosed concurrently only if all criteria are met for both disorders and the feeding disturbance is a primary focus for intervention. Autism spectrum disorder. Individuals with autism spectrum disorder often present with rigid eating behaviors and heightened sensory sensitivities. However, these features do not always result in the level of impairment that would be required for a diagnosis of avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder. Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder should be diagnosed concurrently only if all criteria are met for both disorders and when the eating disturbance requires specific treatment. Specific phobia, social anxiety disorder (social phobia), and other anxiety disorders. Specific phobia, other type, specifies \"situations that may lead to choking or vomiting\" and can represent the primary trigger for the fear, anxiety, or avoidance required for diagnosis. Distinguishing specific phobia from avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder can be difficult when a fear of choking or vomiting has resulted in food avoidance. Although avoidance or restriction of food intake secondary to a pronounced fear of choking or vomiting can be conceptualized as specific phobia, in situations when the eating problem becomes the primary focus of clinical attention, avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder becomes the appropriate diagnosis. In social anxiety disorder, the individual may present with a fear of being observed by others while eating, which can also occur in avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder. Anorexia nervosa. Restriction of energy intake relative to requirements leading to significantly low body weight is a core feature of anorexia nervosa. However, individuals with anorexia nervosa also display a fear of gaining weight or of becoming fat, or persistent behavior that interferes with weight gain, as well as specific disturbances in relation to perception and experience of their own body weight and shape. These features are not present in avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder, and the two disorders should not be diagnosed concurrently. Differential diagnosis between avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder and anorexia nervosa may be difficult, especially in late childhood and early adolescence, because these disorders may share a number of common symptoms (e. g. , food avoidance, low weight). Differential diagnosis is also potentially difficult in individuals with anorexia nervosa who deny any fear of fatness but nonetheless engage in persistent behaviors that prevent weight gain and who do not recognize the medical seriousness of their low weight\u2014a presentation sometimes termed \"non-fat phobic anorexia nervosa. \" Full consideration of symptoms, course, and family history is advised, and diagnosis may be best made in the context of a clinical relationship over time. In some individuals, avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder might precede the onset of anorexia nervosa. Obsessive-compulsive disorder. Individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder may present with avoidance or restriction of intake in relation to preoccupations with food or ritualized eating behavior. Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder should be diagnosed concurrently only if all criteria are met for both disorders and when the aberrant eating is a major aspect of the clinical presentation requiring specific intervention. Major depressive disorder. In major depressive disorder, appetite might be affected to such an extent that individuals present with significantly restricted food intake, usually in relation to overall energy intake and often associated with weight loss. Usually appetite loss and related reduction of intake abate with resolution of mood problems. Avoidant/ restrictive food intake disorder should only be used concurrently if full criteria are met for both disorders and when the eating disturbance requires specific treatment. Schizophrenia spectrum disorders. Individuals with schizophrenia, delusional disorder, or other psychotic disorders may exhibit odd eating behaviors, avoidance of specific foods because of delusional beliefs, or other manifestations of avoidant or restrictive intake. In some cases, delusional beliefs may contribute to a concern about negative consequences of ingesting certain foods. Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder should be used concurrently only if all criteria are met for both disorders and when the eating disturbance requires specific treatment. Factitious disorder or factitious disorder imposed on another. Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder should be differentiated from factitious disorder or factitious disorder imposed on another. In order to assume the sick role, some individuals with factitious disorder may intentionally describe diets that are much more restrictive than those they are actually able to consume, as well as complications of such behavior, such as a need for enteral feedings or nutritional supplements, an inability to tolerate a normal range of foods, and/or an inability to participate normally in age-appropriate situations involving food. The presentation may be impressively dramatic and engaging, and the symptoms reported inconsistently. In factitious disorder imposed on another, the caregiver describes symptoms consistent with avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder and may induce physical symptoms such as failure to gain weight. As with any diagnosis of factitious disorder imposed on another, the caregiver receives the diagnosis rather than the affected individual, and diagnosis should be made only on the basis of a careful, comprehensive assessment of the affected individual, the caregiver, and their interaction\nComorbidity: The most commonly observed disorders comorbid with avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder are anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and neurodevelopmental disorders (specifically autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and intellectual disability [intellectual developmental disorder]). Relationship To Other Classifications:.", "Disorder: Anorexia Nervosa\nICD-9: 307. 1, ICD-10: Variable\nNotes: \nDiagnostic Criteria:\n  A: Restriction of energy intake relative to requirements, leading to a significantly low body weight in tfie context of age, sex, developmental trajectory, and physical health. Significantly low weight is defined as a weight that is less than minimally normal or, for children and adolescents, less than that minimally expected. B: Intense fear of gaining weight or of becoming fat, or persistent behavior that interferes with weight gain, even though at a significantly low weight. C: Disturbance in tlie way in which one\u2019s body weight or shape is experienced, undue influence of body weight or shape on self-evaluation, or persistent lack of recognition of the seriousness of the current low body weight. Disorder Id: 93\nDiagnostic Features: There are three essential features of anorexia nervosa: persistent energy intake restriction; intense fear of gaining weight or of becoming fat, or persistent behavior that interferes with weight gain; and a disturbance in self-perceived weight or shape. The individual maintains a body weight that is below a minimally normal level for age, sex, developmental trajectory, and physical health (Criterion A). Individuals' body weights frequently meet this criterion following a significant weight loss, but among children and adolescents, there may alternatively be failure to make expected weight gain or to maintain a normal developmental trajectory (i. e. , while growing in height) instead of weight loss. Criterion A requires that the individual's weight be significantly low (i. e. , less than minimally normal or, for children and adolescents, less than that minimally expected). Weight assessment can be challenging because normal weight range differs among individuals, and different thresholds have been published defining thinness or underweight status. Body mass index (BMI; calculated as weight in kilograms/height in meters^) is a useful measure to assess body weight for height. For adults, a BMI of 18. 5 kg/m^ has been employed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) as the lower limit of normal body weight. Therefore, most adults with a BMI greater than or equal to 18. 5 kg/m^ would not be considered to have a significantly low body weight. On the other hand, a BMI of lower than 17. 0 kg/m^ has been considered by the WHO to indicate moderate or severe thinness; therefore, an individual with a BMI less than 17. 0 kg/m^ would likely be considered to have a significantly low weight. An adult with a BMI between 17. 0 and 18. 5 kg/m^, or even above 18. 5 kg/m , might be considered to have a significantly low weight if clinical history or other physiological information supports this judgment. For children and adolescents, determining a BMI-for-age percentile is useful (see, e. g. , the CDC BMI percentile calculator for children and teenagers. As for adults, it is not possible to provide definitive standards forjudging whether a child's or an adolescent's weight is significantly low, and variations in developmental trajectories among youth limit the utility of simple numerical guidelines. The CDC has used a BMI-for-age below the 5th percentile as suggesting underweight; however, children and adolescents with a BMI above this benchmark may be judged to be significantly underweight in light of failure to maintain their expected growth trajectory. In summary, in determining whether Criterion A is met, the clinician should consider available numerical guidelines, as well as the individual's body build, weight history, and any physiological disturbances. Individuals with this disorder typically display an intense fear of gaining weight or of becoming fat (Criterion B). This intense fear of becoming fat is usually not alleviated by weight loss. In fact, concern about weight gain may increase even as weight falls. Younger individuals with anorexia nervosa, as well as some adults, may not recognize or acknowledge a fear of weight gain. In the absence of another explanation for the significantly low weight, clinician inference drawn from collateral history, observational data, physical and laboratory findings, or longitudinal course either indicating a fear of weight gain or supporting persistent behaviors that prevent it may be used to establish Criterion B. The experience and significance of body weight and shape are distorted in these individuals (Criterion C). Some individuals feel globally overweight. Others realize that they are thin but are still concerned that certain body parts, particularly the abdomen, buttocks, and thighs, are \"too fat. \" They may employ a variety of techniques to evaluate their body size or weight, including frequent weighing, obsessive measuring of body parts, and persistent use of a mirror to check for perceived areas of \"fat. \" The self-esteem of individuals with anorexia nervosa is highly dependent on their perceptions of body shape and weight. Weight loss is often viewed as an impressive achievement and a sign of extraordinary selfdiscipline, whereas weight gain is perceived as an unacceptable failure of self-control. Although some individuals with this disorder may acknowledge being thin, they often do not recognize the serious medical implications of their malnourished state. Often, the individual is brought to professional attention by family members after marked weight loss (or failure to make expected weight gains) has occurred. If individuals seek help on their own, it is usually because of distress over the somatic and psychological sequelae of starvation. It is rare for an individual with anorexia nervosa to complain of weight loss per se. In fact, individuals with anorexia nervosa frequently either lack insight into or deny the problem. It is therefore often important to obtain information from family members or other sources to evaluate the history of weight loss and other features of the illness. Recording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis: The semi-starvation of anorexia nervosa, and the purging behaviors sometimes associated with it, can result in significant and potentially life-threatening medical conditions. The nutritional compromise associated with this disorder affects most major organ systems and can produce a variety of disturbances. Physiological disturbances, including amenorrhea and vital sign abnormalities, are common. While most of the physiological disturbances associated with malnutrition are reversible with nutritional rehabilitation, some, including loss of bone mineral density, are often not completely reversible. Behaviors such as self-induced vomiting and misuse of laxatives, diuretics, and enemas may cause a number of disturbances that lead to abnormal laboratory findings; however, some individuals with anorexia nervosa exhibit no laboratory abnormalities. When seriously underweight, many individuals with anorexia nervosa have depressive signs and symptoms such as depressed mood, social withdrawal, irritability, insomnia, and diminished interest in sex. Because these features are also observed in individuals without anorexia nervosa who are significantly undernourished, many of the depressive features may be secondary to the physiological sequelae of semi-starvation, although they may also be sufficiently severe to warrant an additional diagnosis of major depressive disorder. Obsessive-compulsive features, both related and unrelated to food, are often prominent. Most individuals with anorexia nervosa are preoccupied with thoughts of food. Some collect recipes or hoard food. Observations of behaviors associated with other forms of starvation suggest that obsessions and compulsions related to food may be exacerbated by imdemutrition. When individuals with anorexia nervosa exhibit obsessions and compulsions that are not related to food, body shape, or weight, an additional diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) may be warranted. Other features sometimes associated with anorexia nervosa include concerns about eating in public, feelings of ineffectiveness, a strong desire to control one's environment, inflexible thinking, limited social spontaneity, and overly restrained emotional expression. Compared with individuals with anorexia nervosa, restricting type, those with binge-eating/purging type have higher rates of impulsivity and are more likely to abuse alcohol and other drugs. A subgroup of individuals with anorexia nervosa show excessive levels of physical activity. Increases in physical activity often precede onset of the disorder, and over the course of the disorder increased activity accelerates weight loss. During treatment, excessive activity may be difficult to control, thereby jeopardizing weight recovery. Individuals with anorexia nervosa may misuse medications, such as by manipulating dosage, in order to achieve weight loss or avoid weight gain. Individuals with diabetes mellitus may omit or reduce insulin doses in order to minimize carbohydrate metabolism. Prevalence: The 12-month prevalence of anorexia nervosa among young females is approximately 0. 4%. Less is known about prevalence among males, but anorexia nervosa is far less common in males than in females, with clinical populations generally reflecting approximately a 10:1 female-to-male ratio. Development And Course: Anorexia nervosa commonly begins during adolescence or young adulthood. It rarely begins before puberty or after age 40, but cases of both early and late onset have been described. The onset of this disorder is often associated with a stressful life event, such as leaving home for college. The course and outcome of anorexia nervosa are highly variable. Younger individuals may manifest atypical features, including denying \"fear of fat. \" Older individuals more likely have a longer duration of illness, and their clinical presentation may include more signs and symptoms of long-standing disorder. Clinicians should not exclude anorexia nervosa from the differential diagnosis solely on the basis of older age. Many individuals have a period of changed eating behavior prior to full criteria for the disorder being met. Some individuals with anorexia nervosa recover fully after a single episode, with some exhibiting a fluctuating pattern of weight gain followed by relapse, and others experiencing a chronic course over many years. Hospitalization may be required to restore weight and to address medical complications. Most individuals with anorexia nervosa experience remission within 5 years of presentation. Among individuals admitted to hospitals, overall remission rates may be lower. The crude mortality rate (CMR) for anorexia nervosa is approximately 5% per decade. Death most commonly results from medical complications associated with the disorder itself or from suicide\nRisk And Prognostic Factors: Temperamental. Individuals who develop anxiety disorders or display obsessional traits in childhood are at increased risk of developing anorexia nervosa. Environmental. Historical and cross-cultural variability in the prevalence of anorexia nervosa supports its association with cultures and settings in which thinness is valued. Occupations and avocations that encourage thinness, such as modeling and elite athletics, are also associated with increased risk. Genetic and physiological. There is an increased risk of anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa among first-degree biological relatives of individuals with the disorder. An increased risk of bipolar and depressive disorders has also been found among first-degree relatives of individuals with anorexia nervosa, particularly relatives of individuals with the binge-eating/purging type. Concordance rates for anorexia nervosa in monozygotic twins are significantly higher than those for dizygotic twins. A range of brain abnormalities has been described in anorexia nervosa using functional imaging technologies (functional magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography). The degree to which these findings reflect changes associated with malnutrition versus primary abnormalities associated with the disorder is unclear. Culture Related Diagnostic Issues: Anorexia nervosa occurs across culturally and socially diverse populations, although available evidence suggests cross-cultural variation in its occurrence and presentation. Anorexia nervosa is probably most prevalent in post-industrialized, high-income countries such as in the United States, many European countries, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan, but its incidence in most low- and middle-income countries is uncertain. Whereas the prevalence of anorexia nervosa appears comparatively low among Latinos, African Americans, and Asians in the United States, clinicians should be aware that mental health service utilization among individuals with an eating disorder is significantly lower in these ethnic groups and that the low rates may reflect an ascertainment bias. The presentation of weight concerns among individuals with eating and feeding disorders varies substantially across cultural contexts. The absence of an expressed intense fear of weight gain, sometimes referred to as \"fat phobia,\" appears to be relatively more common in populations in Asia, where the rationale for dietary restriction is commonly related to a more culturally sanctioned complaint such as gastrointestinal discomfort. Within the United States, presentations without a stated intense fear of weight gain may be comparatively more common among Latino groups. Gender Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nSuicide Risk: Suicide risk is elevated in anorexia nervosa, with rates reported as 12 per 100,000 per year. Comprehensive evaluation of individuals with anorexia nervosa should include assessment of suicide-related ideation and behaviors as well as other risk factors for suicide, including a history of suicide attempt(s). Functional Consequences: Individuals with anorexia nervosa may exhibit a range of functional limitations associated with the disorder. While some individuals remain active in social and professional functioning, others demonstrate significant social isolation and/or failure to fulfill academic or career potential. Diagnostic Markers: The following laboratory abnormalities may be observed in anorexia nervosa; their presence may serve to increase diagnostic confidence. Hematology. Leukopenia is common, with the loss of all cell types but usually with apparent lympho<^ytosis. Mild anemia can occur, as well as thrombocytopenia and, rarely, bleeding problems. Serum chemistry. Dehydration may be reflected by an elevated blood urea nitrogen level. Hypercholesterolemia is common. Hepatic enzyme levels may be elevated. Hypomagnesemia, hypozincemia, hypophosphatemia, and hyperamylasemia are occasionally observed. Self-induced vomiting may lead to metabolic alkalosis (elevated serum bicarbonate), hypochloremia, and hypokalemia; laxative abuse may cause a mild metabolic acidosis. Endocrine. Serum thyroxine (T4) levels are usually in the low-normal range; triiodothyronine (T3) levels are decreased, while reverse T3 levels are elevated. Females have low serum estrogen levels, whereas males have low levels of serum testosterone. Electrocardiography. Sinus bradycardia is common, and, rarely, arrhythmias are noted. Significant prolongation of the QTc interval is observed in some individuals. Bone mass. Low bone mineral density, with specific areas of osteopenia or osteoporosis, is often seen. The risk of fracture is significantly elevated. Electroencephalography. Diffuse abnormalities, reflecting a metabolic encephalopathy, may result from significant fluid and electrolyte disturbances. Resting energy expenditure. There is often a significant reduction in resting energy expenditure. Physical signs and symptoms. Many of the physical signs and symptoms of anorexia nervosa are attributable to starvation. Amenorrhea is commonly present and appears to be an indicator of physiological dysfunction. If present, amenorrhea is usually a consequence of the weight loss, but in a minority of individuals it may actually precede the weight loss. In prepubertal females, menarche maybe delayed. In addition to amenorrhea, there may be complaints of constipation, abdominal pain, cold intolerance, lethargy, and excess energy. The most remarkable finding on physical examination is emaciation. Commonly, there is also significant hypotension, hypothermia, and bradycardia. Some individuals develop lanugo, a fine downy body hair. Some develop peripheral edema, especially during weight restoration or upon cessation of laxative and diuretic abuse. Rarely, petechiae or ecchymoses, usually on the extremities, may indicate a bleeding diathesis. Some individuals evidence a yellowing of the skin associated with hypercarotenemia. As may be seen in individuals with bulimia nervosa, individuals with anorexia nervosa who self-induce vomiting may have hypertrophy of the salivary glands, particularly the parotid glands, as well as dental enamel erosion. Some individuals may have scars or calluses on the dorsal surface of the hand from repeated contact with the teeth while inducing vomiting. Differential Diagnosis: Other possible causes of either significantly low body weight or significant weight loss should be considered in the differential diagnosis of anorexia nervosa, especially when the presenting features are atypical (e. g. , onset after age 40 years). Medical conditions (e. g. , gastrointestinal disease, hypeiihyroidism, occult malignancies, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS]). Serious weight loss may occur in medical conditions, but individuals with these disorders usually do not also manifest a disturbance in the way their body weight or shape is experienced or an intense fear of weight gain or persist in behaviors that interfere with appropriate weight gain. Acute weight loss associated with a medical condition can occasionally be followed by the onset or recurrence of anorexia nervosa, which can initially be masked by the comorbid medical condition. Rarely, anorexia nervosa develops after bariatric surgery for obesity. Major depressive disorder. In major depressive disorder, severe weight loss may occur, but most individuals with major depressive disorder do not have either a desire for excessive weight loss or an intense fear of gaining weight. Schizophrenia. Individuals with schizophrenia may exhibit odd eating behavior and occasionally experience significant weight loss, but they rarely show the fear of gaining weight and the body image disturbance required for a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa. Substance use disorders. Individuals with substance use disorders may experience low weight due to poor nutritional intake but generally do not fear gaining weight and do not manifest body image disturbance. Individuals who abuse substances that reduce appetite (e. g. , cocaine, stimulants) and who also endorse fear of weight gain should be carefully evaluated for the possibility of comorbid anorexia nervosa, given that the substance use may represent a persistent behavior that interferes with weight gain (Criterion B). Social anxiety disorder (social phobia), obsessive-compulsive disorder, and body dysmorphic disorder. Some of the features of anorexia nervosa overlap with the criteria for social phobia, OCD, and body dysmorphic disorder. Specifically, individuals may feel humiliated or embarrassed to be seen eating in public, as in social phobia; may exhibit obsessions and compulsions related to food, as in OCD; or may be preoccupied with an imagined defect in bodily appearance, as in body dysmorphic disorder. If the individual with anorexia nervosa has social fears that are limited to eating behavior alone, the diagnosis of social phobia should not be made, but social fears unrelated to eating behavior (e. g. , excessive fear of speaking in public) may warrant an additional diagnosis of social phobia. Similarly, an additional diagnosis of OCD should be considered only if the individual exhibits obsessions and compulsions unrelated to food (e. g. , an excessive fear of contamination), and an additional diagnosis of body dysmorphic disorder should be considered only if the distortion is unrelated to body shape and size (e. g. , preoccupation that one's nose is too big). Bulimia nervosa. Individuals with bulimia nervosa exhibit recurrent episodes of binge eating, engage in inappropriate behavior to avoid weight gain (e. g. , self-induced vomiting), and are overly concerned with body shape and weight. However, unlike individuals with anorexia nervosa, binge-eating/purging type, individuals with bulimia nervosa maintain body weight at or above a minimally normal level. Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder. Individuals with this disorder may exhibit significant weight loss or significant nutritional deficiency, but they do not have a fear of gaining weight or of becoming fat, nor do they have a disturbance in the way they experience their body shape and weight. Comorbidity: Bipolar, depressive, and anxiety disorders commonly co-occur with anorexia nervosa. Many individuals with anorexia nervosa report the presence of either an anxiety disorder or symptoms prior to onset of their eating disorder. OCD is described in some individuals with anorexia nervosa, especially those with the restricting type. Alcohol use disorder and other substance use disorders may also be comorbid with anorexia nervosa, especially among those with the binge-eating/purging type.

Disorder Id: 94\nDiagnostic Features: There are three essential features of bulimia nervosa: recurrent episodes of binge eating (Criterion A), recurrent inappropriate compensatory behaviors to prevent weight gain (Criterion B), and self-evaluation that is unduly influenced by body shape and weight (Criterion D). To qualify for the diagnosis, the binge eating and inappropriate compensatory behaviors must occur, on average, at least once per week for 3 months (Criterion C). An \"episode of binge eating\" is defined as eating, in a discrete period of time, an amount of food that is definitely larger than most individuals would eat in a similar period of time under similar circumstances (Criterion Al). The context in which the eating occurs may affect the clinician's estimation of whether the intake is excessive. For example, a quantity of food that might be regarded as excessive for a typical meal might be considered normal during a celebration or holiday meal. A \"discrete period of time\" refers to a limited period, usually less than 2 hours. A single episode of binge eating need not be restricted to one setting. For example, an individual may begin a binge in a restaurant and then continue to eat on returning home. Continual snacking on small amounts of food throughout the day would not be considered an eating binge. An occurrence of excessive food consumption must be accompanied by a sense of lack of control (Criterion A2) to be considered an episode of binge eating. An indicator of loss of control is the inability to refrain from eating or to stop eating once started. Some individuals describe a dissociative quality during, or following, the binge-eating episodes. The impairment in control associated with binge eating may not be absolute; for example, an individual may continue binge eating while the telephone is ringing but will cease if a roommate or spouse unexpectedly enters the room. Some individuals report that their binge-eating episodes are no longer characterized by an acute feeling of loss of control but rather by a more generalized pattern of uncontrolled eating. If individuals report that they have abandoned efforts to control their eating, loss of control should be considered as present. Binge eating can also be planned in some instances. The type of food consumed during binges varies both across individuals and for a given individual. Binge eating appears to be characterized more by an abnormality in the amount of food consumed than by a craving for a specific nutrient. However, during binges, individuals tend to eat foods they would otherwise avoid. Individuals with bulimia nervosa are typically ashamed of their eating problems and attempt to conceal their symptoms. Binge eating usually occurs in secrecy or as inconspicuously as possible. The binge eating often continues until the individual is uncomfortably, or even painfully, full. The most common antecedent of binge eating is negative affect. Other triggers include interpersonal stressors; dietary restraint; negative feelings related to body weight, body shape, and food; and boredom. Binge eating may minimize or mitigate factors that precipitated the episode in the short-term, but negative self-evaluation and dysphoria often are the delayed consequences. Another essential feature of bulimia nervosa is the recurrent use of inappropriate compensatory behaviors to prevent weight gain, collectively referred to as purge behaviors or purging (Criterion B). Many individuals with bulimia nervosa employ several methods to compensate for binge eating. Vomiting is the most common inappropriate compensatory behavior. The immediate effects of vomiting include relief from physical discomfort and reduction of fear of gaining weight. In some cases, vomiting becomes a goal in itself, and the individual will binge eat in order to vomit or will vomit after eating a small amount of food. Individuals with bulimia nervosa may use a variety of methods to induce vomiting, including the use of fingers or instruments to stimulate the gag reflex. Individuals generally become adept at inducing vomiting and are eventually able to vomit at will. Rarely, individuals consume syrup of ipecac to induce vomiting. Other purging behaviors include the misuse of laxatives and diuretics. A number of other compensatory methods may also be used in rare cases. Individuals with bulimia nervosa may misuse enemas following episodes of binge eating, but this is seldom the sole compensatory method employed. Individuals with this disorder may take thyroid hormone in an attempt to avoid weight gain. Individuals with diabetes mellitus and bulimia nervosa may omit or reduce insulin doses in order to reduce the metabolism of food consumed during eating binges. Individuals with bulimia nervosa may fast for a day or more or exercise excessively in an attempt to prevent weight gain. Exercise may be considered excessive when it significantly interferes with important activities, when it occurs at inappropriate times or in inappropriate settings, or when the individual continues to exercise despite injury or other medical complications. Individuals with bulimia nervosa place an excessive emphasis on body shape or weight in their self-evaluation, and these factors are typically extremely important in determining self-esteem (Criterion D). Individuals with this disorder may closely resemble those w^ith anorexia nervosa in their fear of gaining weight, in their desire to lose weight, and in the level of dissatisfaction with their bodies. However, a diagnosis of bulimia nervosa should not be given when the disturbance occurs only during episodes of anorexia nervosa (Criterion E). Recording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis: Individuals with bulimia nervosa typically are within the normal weight or overweight range (body mass index [BMI] > 18. 5 and < 30 in adults). The disorder occurs but is uncommon among obese individuals. Between eating binges, individuals with bulimia nervosa typically restrict their total caloric consumption and preferentially select low-calorie (\"diet\") foods while avoiding foods that they perceive to be fattening or likely to trigger a binge. Menstrual irregularity or amenorrhea often occurs among females with bulimia nervosa; it is uncertain whether such disturbances are related to weight fluctuations, to nutritional deficiencies, or to emotional distress. The fluid and electrolyte disturbances resulting from the purging behavior are sometimes sufficiently severe to constitute medically serious problems. Rare but potentially fatal complications include esophageal tears, gastric rupture, and cardiac arrhythmias. Serious cardiac and skeletal myopathies have been reported among individuals following repeated use of syrup of ipecac to induce vomiting. Individuals who chronically abuse laxatives may become dependent on their use to stimulate bowel movements. Gastrointestinal symptoms are commonly associated with bulimia nervosa, and rectal prolapse has also been reported among individuals with this disorder. Prevalence: Twelve-month prevalence of bulimia nervosa among young females is 1%-1. 5%. Point prevalence is highest among young adults since the disorder peaks in older adolescence and young adulthood. Less is known about the point prevalence of bulimia nervosa in males, but bulimia nervosa is far less common in males than it is in females, with an approximately 10:1 female-to-male ratio. Development And Course: Bulimia nervosa commonly begins in adolescence or young adulthood. Onset before puberty or after age 40 is uncommon. The binge eating frequently begins during or after an episode of dieting to lose weight. Experiencing multiple stressful life events also can precipitate onset of bulimia nervosa. Disturbed eating behavior persists for at least several years in a high percentage of clinic samples. The course may be chronic or intermittent, with periods of remission alternating with recurrences of binge eating. However, over longer-term follow-up, the symptoms of many individuals appear to diminish with or without treatment, although treatment clearly impacts outcome. Periods of remission longer than 1 year are associated with better long-term outcome. Significantly elevated risk for mortality (all-cause and suicide) has been reported for individuals with bulimia nervosa. The CMR (crude mortality rate) for bulimia nervosa is nearly 2% per decade. Diagnostic cross-over from initial bulimia nervosa to anorexia nervosa occurs in a minority of cases (10%-15%). Individuals who do experience cross-over to anorexia nervosa commonly will revert back to bulimia nervosa or have multiple occurrences of cross-overs between these disorders. A subset of individuals with bulimia nervosa continue to binge eat but no longer engage in inappropriate compensatory behaviors, and therefore their symptoms meet criteria for binge-eating disorder or other specified eating disorder. Diagnosis should be based on the current (i. e. , past 3 months) clinical presentation. Risk And Prognostic Factors: Temperamental. Weight concerns, low self-esteem, depressive symptoms, social anxiety disorder, and overanxious disorder of childhood are associated with increased risk for the development of bulimia nervosa. Environmental. Internalization of a thin body ideal has been found to increase risk for developing weight concerns, which in turn increase risk for the development of bulimia nervosa. Individuals who experienced childhood sexual or physical abuse are at increased risk for developing bulimia nervosa. Genetic and physiological. Childhood obesity and early pubertal maturation increase risk for bulimia nervosa. Familial transmission of bulimia nervosa may be present, as well as genetic vulnerabilities for the disorder. Course modifiers. Severity of psychiatric comorbidity predicts worse long-term outcome of bulimia nervosa. Culture Related Diagnostic Issues: Bulimia nervosa has been reported to occur with roughly similar frequencies in most industrialized countries, including the United States, Canada, many European countries, Australia, Japan, New Zealand, and South Africa. In clinical studies of bulimia nervosa in the United States, individuals presenting with this disorder are primarily white. However, the disorder also occurs in other ethnic groups and with prevalence comparable to estimated prevalences observed in white samples. Gender Related Diagnostic Issues: Bulimia nervosa is far more common in females than in males. Males are especially underrepresented in treatment-seeking samples, for reasons that have not yet been systematically examined\nSuicide Risk: Suicide risk is elevated in bulimia nervosa. Comprehensive evaluation of individuals with this disorder should include assessment of suicide-related ideation and behaviors as well as other risk factors for suicide, including a history of suicide attempts. Functional Consequences: Individuals with bulimia nervosa may exhibit a range of functional limitations associated with the disorder. A minority of individuals report severe role impairment, with the social-life domain most likely to be adversely affected by bulimia nervosa. Diagnostic Markers: No specific diagnostic test for bulimia nervosa currently exists. However, several laboratory abnormalities may occur as a consequence of purging and may increase diagnostic certainty. These include fluid and electrolyte abnormalities, such as hypokalemia (which can provoke cardiac arrhythmias), hypochloremia, and hyponatremia. The loss of gastric acid through vomiting may produce a metabolic alkalosis (elevated serum bicarbonate), and the frequent induction of diarrhea or dehydration through laxative and diuretic abuse can cause metabolic acidosis. Some individuals with bulimia nervosa exhibit mildly elevated levels of serum amylase, probably reflecting an increase in the salivary isoenzyme. Physical examination usually yields no physical findings. However, inspection of the mouth may reveal significant and permanent loss of dental enamel, especially from lingual surfaces of the front teeth due to recurrent vomiting. These teeth may become chipped and appear ragged and \"moth-eaten. \" There may also be an increased frequency of dental caries. In some individuals, the salivary glands, particularly the parotid glands, may become notably enlarged. Individuals who induce vomiting by manually stimulating the gag reflex may develop calluses or scars on the dorsal surface of the hand from repeated contact with the teeth. Serious cardiac and skeletal myopathies have been reported among individuals following repeated use of syrup of ipecac to induce vomiting\nDifferential Diagnosis: Anorexia nervosa, binge-eating/purging type. Individuals whose binge-eating behavior occurs only during episodes of anorexia nervosa are given the diagnosis anorexia nervosa, binge-eating/purging type, and should not be given the additional diagnosis of bulimia nervosa. For individuals with an initial diagnosis of anorexia nervosa who binge and purge but whose presentation no longer meets the full criteria for anorexia nervosa, binge-eating/purging type (e. g. , when weight is normal), a diagnosis of bulimia nervosa should be given only when all criteria for bulimia nervosa have been met for at least 3 months. Binge-eating disorder. Some individuals binge eat but do not engage in regular inappropriate compensatory behaviors. In these cases, the diagnosis of binge-eating disorder should be considered. Kleine-Levin syndrome. In certain neurological or other medical conditions, such as Kleine-Levin syndrome, there is disturbed eating behavior, but the characteristic psychological features of bulimia nervosa, such as overconcem with body shape and weight, are not present. Major depressive disorder, with atypical features. Overeating is common in major depressive disorder, with atypical features, but individuals with this disorder do not engage in inappropriate compensatory behaviors and do not exhibit the excessive concern with body shape and weight characteristic of bulimia nervosa. If criteria for both disorders are met, both diagnoses should be given. Borderline personality disorder. Binge-eating behavior is included in the impulsive behavior criterion that is part of the definition of borderline personality disorder. If the criteria for both borderline personality disorder and bulimia nervosa are met, both diagnoses should be given. Comorbidity: Comorbidity with mental disorders is common in individuals with bulimia nervosa, with most experiencing at least one other mental disorder and many experiencing multiple comorbidities. Comorbidity is not limited to any particular subset but rather occurs across a wide range of mental disorders. There is an increased frequency of depressive symptoms (e. g. , low self-esteem) and bipolar and depressive disorders (particularly depressive disorders) in individuals with bulimia nervosa. In many individuals, the mood disturbance begins at the same time as or following the development of bulimia nervosa, and individuals often ascribe their mood disturbances to the bulimia nervosa. However, in some individuals, the mood disturbance clearly precedes the development of bulimia nervosa. There may also be an increased frequency of anxiety symptoms (e. g. , fear of social situations) or anxiety disorders. These mood and anxiety disturbances frequently remit follow\u00ad ing effective treatment of the bulimia nervosa. The lifetime prevalence of substance use, particularly alcohol or stimulant use, is at least 30% among individuals with bulimia nervosa. Stimulant use often begins in an attempt to control appetite and weight. A substantial percentage of individuals with bulimia nervosa also have personality features that meet criteria for one or more personality disorders, most frequently borderline personality disorder.

An \"episode of binge eating\" is defined as eating, in a discrete period of time, an amount of food that is defi\u00ad nitely larger than most people would eat in a similar period of time under similar circumstances (Criterion Al).

The type of food consumed during binges varies both across individuals and for a given individual. Binge eating appears to be characterized more by an abnormality in the amount of food consumed than by a craving for a specific nutrient. Binge eating must be characterized by marked distress (Criterion C) and at least three of the following features: eating much more rapidly than normal; eating until feeling uncomfortably full; eating large amoimts of food when not feeling physically hungry; eating alone because of feeling embarrassed by how much one is eating; and feeling disgusted with oneself, depressed, or very guilty afterward (Criterion B). Individuals with binge-eating disorder are typically ashamed of their eating problems and attempt to conceal their symptoms. Binge eating usually occurs in secrecy or as inconspicuously as possible. The most common antecedent of binge eating is negative affect. Other triggers include inte\u03c6ersonal stressors; dietary restraint; negative feelings related to body weight, body shape, and food; and boredom. Binge eating may miriimize or mitigate factors that precipitated the episode in the short-term, but negative self-evaluation and dysphoria often are the delayed consequences\nRecording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis: Binge-eating disorder occurs in normal-weight/overweight and obese individuals. It is reliably associated with overweight and obesity in treatment-seeking individuals. Nevertheless, binge-eating disorder is distinct from obesity. Most obese individuals do not engage in recurrent binge eating. In addition, compared with weight-matched obese individuals without binge-eating disorder, those with the disorder consume more calories in laboratory studies of eating behavior and have greater functional impairment, lower quality of life, more subjective distress, and greater psychiatric comorbidity\nPrevalence: Twelve-month prevalence of binge-eating disorder among U. S. adult (age 18 or older) females and males is 1. 6% and 0. 8%, respectively. The gender ratio is far less skewed in bingeeating disorder than in bulimia nervosa. Binge-eating disorder is as prevalent among females from racial or ethnic minority groups as has been reported for white females. The disorder is more prevalent among individuals seeking weight-loss treatment than in the general population. Development And Course: Little is known about the development of binge-eating disorder. Both binge eating and loss-of-control eating without objectively excessive consumption occur in children and are associated with increased body fat, weight gain, and increases in psychological symptoms. Binge eating is common in adolescent and college-age samples. Loss-of-control eating or episodic binge eating may represent a prodromal phase of eating disorders for some individuals. Dieting follows the development of binge eating in many individuals with bingeeating disorder. (This is in contrast to bulimia nervosa, in which dysfunctional dieting usually precedes the onset of binge eating. ) Binge-eating disorder typically begins in adolescence or young adulthood but can begin in later adulthood. Individuals with bingeeating disorder who seek treatment usually are older than individuals with either bulimia nervosa or anorexia nervosa who seek treatment. Remission rates in both natural course and treatment outcome studies are higher for binge-eating disorder than for bulimia nervosa or anorexia nervosa. Binge-eating disorder appears to be relatively persistent, and the course is comparable to that of bulimia nervosa in terms of severity and duration. Crossover from binge-eating disorder to other eating disorders is uncommon. Risk And Prognostic Factors: Genetic and physiological. Binge-eating disorder appears to run in families, which may reflect additive genetic influences. Culture Related Diagnostic Issues: Binge-eating disorder occurs with roughly similar frequencies in most industrialized countries, including the United States, Canada, many European countries, Australia, and New Zealand. In the United States, the prevalence of binge-eating disorder appears comparable among non-Latino whites. Latinos, Asians, and African Americans. Gender Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nSuicide Risk:  \nFunctional Consequences: Binge-eating disorder is associated with a range of functional consequences, including social role adjustment problems, impaired health-related quality of life and life satisfaction, increased medical morbidity and mortality, and associated increased health care utilization compared with body mass index (BMI)-matched control subjects. It may also be associated with an increased risk for weight gain and the development of obesity. Diagnostic Markers:  \nDifferential Diagnosis: Bulimia neivosa. Binge-eating disorder has recurrent binge eating in common with bulimia nervosa but differs from the latter disorder in some fundamental respects. In terms of clinical presentation, the recurrent inappropriate compensatory behavior (e. g. , purging, driven exercise) seen in bulimia nervosa is absent in binge-eating disorder. Unlike individuals with bulimia nervosa, individuals with binge-eating disorder typically do not show marked or sustained dietary restriction designed to influence body weight and shape between binge-eating episodes. They may, however, report frequent attempts at dieting. Binge-eating disorder also differs from bulimia nervosa in terms of response to treatment. Rates of improvement are consistently higher among individuals with binge-eating disorder than among those with bulimia nervosa. Obesity. Binge-eating disorder is associated with overweight and obesity but has several key features that are distinct from obesity. First, levels of overvaluation of body weight and shape are higher in obese individuals with the disorder than in those without the disorder. Second, rates of psychiatric comorbidity are significantly higher among obese individuals with the disorder compared with those without the disorder. Third, the long-term successful outcome of evidence-based psychological treatments for bingeeating disorder can be contrasted with the absence of effective long-term treatments for obesity. Bipolar and depressive disorders. Increases in appetite and weight gain are included in the criteria for major depressive episode and in the atypical features specifiers for depressive and bipolar disorders. Increased eating in the context of a major depressive episode may or may not be associated with loss of control. If the full criteria for both disorders are met, both diagnoses can be given. Binge eating and other symptoms of disordered eating are seen in association with bipolar disorder. If the full criteria for both disorders are met, both diagnoses should be given. Borderline personality disorder. Binge eating is included in the impulsive behavior criterion that is part of the definition of borderline personality disorder. If the full criteria for both disorders are met, both diagnoses should be given. Comorbidity: Binge-eating disorder is associated with significant psychiatric comorbidity that is comparable to that of bulimia nervosa and anorexia nervosa. The most common comorbid disorders are bipolar disorders, depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, and, to a lesser degree, substance use disorders. The psychiatric comorbidity is linked to the severity of binge eating and not to the degree of obesity. Relationship To Other Classifications:.", "Disorder: Other Specified Feeding or Eating Disorder\nICD-9: 307. 59, ICD-10: F50. 8\nNotes: This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a feeding and eating disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the feeding and eating disorders diagnostic class. The other specified feeding or eating disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific feeding and eating disorder. This is done by recording \u201cother specified feeding or eating disorder\u201d followed by the specific reason (e. g. , \u201cbulimia nervosa of low frequency\u201d)\nDiagnostic Criteria:\n  1: Atypical anorexia nervosa: All of the criteria for anorexia nervosa are met, except that despite significant weight loss, the individual\u2019s weight is within or above the normal range. 2: Bulimia nervosa (of low frequency and/or limited duration): All of the criteria for bulimia nervosa are met, except that the binge eating and inappropriate compensatory behaviors occur, on average, less than once a week and/or for less than 3 months. 3: Binge-eating disorder (of low frequency and/or limited duration): All of the criteria for binge-eating disorder are met, except that the binge eating occurs, on average, less than once a week and/or for less than 3 months\n  4: Purging disorder: Recurrent purging behavior to influence weight or shape (e. g. , self-induced vomiting: misuse of laxatives, diuretics, or other medications) in the absence of binge eating\n  5: Night eating syndrome: Recurrent episodes of night eating, as manifested by eating after awakening from sleep or by excessive food consumption after the evening meal. There Is awareness and recall of the eating. The night eating is not better explained by external influences such as changes in the individual\u2019s sleep-wake cycle or by local social norms.

The unspecified feeding and eating disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for a specific feeding and eating disorder, and includes presentations in which there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis (e. g. , in emergency room settings). Diagnostic Criteria:\nProperties:.", "Disorder: Enuresis\nICD-9: 307. 6, ICD-10: F98. 0\nNotes: \nDiagnostic Criteria:\n  A: Repeated voiding of urine into bed or clothes, whether involuntary or intentional. B: The behavior is clinically significant as manifested by either a frequency of at least twice a week for at least 3 consecutive months or the presence of clinically significant distress or impairment in social, academic (occupational), or other important areas of functioning. C: Chronological age is at least 5 years (or equivalent developmental level). D: The behavior is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e. g. , a diuretic, an antipsychotic medication) or another medical condition (e. g. , diabetes, spina bifida, a seizure disorder). Disorder Id: 98\nDiagnostic Features: The essential feature of enuresis is repeated voiding of urine during the day or at night into bed or clothes (Criterion A). Most often the voiding is involuntary, but occasionally it may be intentional. To qualify for a diagnosis of enuresis, the voiding of urine must occur at least twice a week for at least 3 consecutive months or must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, academic (occupational), or other important areas of functioning (Criterion B). The individual must have reached an age at which continence is expected (i. e. , a chronological age of at least 5 years or, for children with developmental delays, a mental age of at least 5 years) (Criterion C). The urinary incontinence is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e. g. , a diuretic, an antipsychotic medication) or another medical condition (e. g. , diabetes, spina bifida, a seizure disorder) (Criterion D). Recording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis: Ehiring nocturnal enuresis, occasionally the voiding takes place during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and the child may recall a dream that involved the act of urinating. During daytime (diurnal) enuresis, the child defers voiding until incontinence occurs, sometimes because of a reluctance to use the toilet as a result of social anxiety or a preoccupation with school or play activity. The enuretic event most commonly occurs in the early afternoon on school days and may be associated with symptoms of disruptive behavior. The enuresis commonly persists after appropriate treatment of an associated infection\nPrevalence: The prevalence of enuresis is 5%-10% among 5-year-olds, 3%-5% among 10-year-olds, and around 1% among individuals 15 years or older\nDevelopment And Course: Two types of course of enuresis have been described: a \"primary\" type, in which the individual has never established urinary continence, and a \"secondary\" type, in which the disturbance develops after a period of established urinary continence. There are no differences in prevalence of comorbid mental disorders between the two types. By definition, primary enuresis begins at age 5 years. The most common time for the onset of secondary enuresis is between ages 5 and 8 years, but it may occur at any time. After age 5 years, the rate of spontaneous remission is 5%-10% per year. Most children with the disorder become continent by adolescence, but in approximately 1% of cases the disorder continues into adulthood. Diurnal enuresis is uncommon after age 9 years. While occasional diurnal incontinence is not uncommon in middle childhood, it is substantially more common in those who also have persistent nocturnal enuresis. When enuresis persists into late childhood or adolescence, the frequency of incontinence may increase, whereas continence in early childhood is usually associated with a declining frequency of wet nights\nRisk And Prognostic Factors: Environmental. A number of predisposing factors for enuresis have been suggested, including delayed or lax toilet training and psychosocial stress. Genetic and physiological. Enuresis has been associated with delays in the development of normal circadian rhythms of urine production, with resulting nocturnal polyuria or abnormalities of central vasopressin receptor sensitivity, and reduced functional bladder capacities with bladder hyperreactivity (unstable bladder syndrome). Nocturnal enuresis is a genetically heterogeneous disorder. Heritability has been shown in family, twin, and segregation analyses. Risk for childhood nocturnal enuresis is approximately 3. 6 times higher in offspring of enuretic mothers and 10. 1 times higher in the presence of paternal urinary incontinence. The risk magnitudes for nocturnal enuresis and diurnal incontinence are similar. Culture Related Diagnostic Issues: Enuresis has beeh reported in a variety of European, African, and Asian countries as well as in the United States. At a national level, prevalence rates are remarkably similar, and there is great similarity in the developmental trajectories found in different countries. There are very high rates of enuresis in orphanages and other residential institutions, likely related to the mode and environment in which toilet training occurs\nGender Related Diagnostic Issues: Nocturnal enuresis is more common in males. Diurnal incontinence is more common in females. The relative risk of having a child who develops enuresis is greater for previously enuretic fathers than for previously enuretic mothers. Suicide Risk:  \nFunctional Consequences: The amount of impairment associated with enuresis is a function of the limitation on the child's social activities (e. g. , ineligibility for sleep-away camp) or its effect on the child's self-esteem, the degree of social ostracism by peers, and the anger, punishment, and rejection on the part of caregivers. Diagnostic Markers:  \nDifferential Diagnosis: Neurogenic bladder or another medical condition. The diagnosis of enuresis is not made in the presence of a neurogenic bladder or another medical condition that causes polyuria or urgency (e. g. , untreated diabetes mellitus or diabetes insipidus) or during an acute urinary tract infection. However, a diagnosis is compatible with such conditions if urinary incontinence was regularly present prior to the development of another medical condition or if it persists after the institution of appropriate treatment of the medical condition. Medication side effects. Enuresis may occur during treatment with antipsychotic medications, diuretics, or other medications that may induce incontinence. In this case, the diagnosis should not be made in isolation but may be noted as a medication side effect. However, a diagnosis of enuresis may be made if urinary incontinence was regularly present prior to treatment with the medication\nComorbidity: Although most children with enuresis do not have a comorbid mental disorder, the prevalence of comorbid behavioral symptoms is higher in children with enuresis than in children without enuresis. Developmental delays, including speech, language, learning, and motor skills delays, are also present in a portion of children with enuresis. Encopresis, sleepwalking, and sleep terror disorder may be present. Urinary tract infections are more common in children with enuresis, especially the diurnal subtype, than in those who are continent\nRelationship To Other Classifications:.", "Disorder: Encopresis\nICD-9: 307. 7, ICD-10: F98. 1\nNotes: \nDiagnostic Criteria:\n  A: Repeated passage of feces into inappropriate places (e. g. , clothing, floor), whether involuntary or intentional.

D: The behavior is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e. g. , laxatives) or another medical condition except through a mechanism involving constipation\nDisorder Id: 99\nDiagnostic Features: The essential feature of encopresis is repeated passage of feces into inappropriate places (e. g. , clothing or floor) (Criterion A). Most often the passage is involimtary but occasionally may be intentional. The event must occur at least once a month for at least 3 months (Criterion B), and the chronological age of the child must be at least 4 years (or for children with developmental delays, the mental age must be at least 4 years) (Criterion C). The fecal incontinence must not be exclusively attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e. g. , laxatives) or another medical condition except through a mechanism involving constipation (Criterion D). When the passage of feces is involuntary rather than intentional, it is often related to constipation, impaction, and retention with subsequent overflow. The constipation may develop for psychological reasons (e. g. , anxiety about defecating in a particular place, a more general pattern of anxious or oppositional behavior), leading to avoidance of defecation. Physiological predispositions to constipation include ineffectual straining or paradoxical defecation dynamics, with contraction rather than relaxation of the external sphincter or pelvic floor during straining for defecation. Dehydration associated with a febrile illness, hypothyroidism, or a medication side effect can also induce constipation. Once constipation has developed, it may be complicated by an anal fissure, painful defecation, and further fecal retention. The consistency of the stool may vary. In some individuals the stool may be of normal or near-normal consistency. In other individuals\u2014such as those with overflow incontinence secondary to fecal retention\u2014it may be liquid. Recording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis: The child with encopresis often feels ashamed and may wish to avoid situations (e. g. , camp, school) that might lead to embarrassment. The amount of impairment is a function of the effect on the child's self-esteem, the degree of social ostracism by peers, and the anger, punishment, and rejection on the part of caregivers. Smearing feces may be deliberate or accidental, resulting from the child's attempt to clean or hide feces that were passed involuntarily. When the incontinence is clearly deliberate, features of oppositional defiant disorder or conduct disorder may also be present. Many children with encopresis and chronic constipation also have enuresis symptoms and may have associated urinary reflux in the bladder or ureters that may lead to chronic urinary infections, the symptoms of which may remit with treatment of the constipation\nPrevalence: It is estimated thiht approximately 1% of 5-year-olds have encopresis, and the disorder is more common in males than in females. Development And Course: Encopresis is not diagnosed until a child has reached a chronological age of at least 4 years (or for children with developmental delays, a mental age of at least 4 years). Inadequate, inconsistent toilet training and psychosocial stress (e. g. , entering school, the birth of a sibling) may be predisposing factors. Two types of course have been described: a \"primary\" type, in which the individual has never established fecal continence, and a \"secondary\" type, in which the disturbance develops after a period of established fecal continence. Encopresis can persist, with intermittent exacerbations, for years. Risk And Prognostic Factors: Genetic and physiological. Painful defecation can lead to constipation and a cycle of withholding behaviors that make encopresis more likely. Use of some medications (e. g. , anticonvulsants, cough suppressants) may increase constipation and make encopresis more likely. Culture Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nGender Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nSuicide Risk:  \nFunctional Consequences:  \nDiagnostic Markers: In addition to physical examination, gastrointestinal imaging (e. g. , abdominal radiograph) may be informative to assess retained stool and gas in the colon. Additional tests, such as barium enema and anorectal manography, may be used to help exclude other medical conditions, such as Hirschsprung's disease. Differential Diagnosis: A diagnosis of encopresis in the presence of another medical condition is appropriate only if the mechanism involves constipation that cannot be explained by other medical conditions. Fecal incontinence related to other medical conditions (e. g. , chronic diarrhea, spina bifida, anal stenosis) would not warrant a DSM-5 diagnosis of encopresis. Comorbidity: Urinary tract infections can be comorbid with encopresis and are more common in females\nRelationship To Other Classifications:.", "Disorder: Other Specified Elimination Disorder\nICD-9: Variable, ICD-10: Variable\nNotes: This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of an elimination disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the elimination disorders diagnostic class.

H: Coexisting mental disorders and medical conditions do not adequately explain the predominant complaint of insomnia. Disorder Id: 102\nDiagnostic Features: The essential feature of insomnia disorder is dissatisfaction with sleep quantity or quality with complaints of difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep. The sleep complaints are accompanied by clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The sleep disturbance may occur during the course of another mental disorder or medical condition, or it may occur independently. Different manifestations of insomnia can occur at different times of the sleep period. Sleeponset insomnia (or initial insomnia) involves difficulty initiating sleep at bedtime. Sleep maintenance insomnia (or middle insomnia) involves frequent or prolonged awakenings throughout the night. Late insomnia involves early-morning awakening with an inability to return to sleep. Difficulty maintaining sleep is the most common single symptom of insomnia, followed by difficulty falling asleep, while a combination of these symptoms is the most common presentation overall. The specific type of sleep complaint often varies over time. Individuals who complain of difficulty falling asleep at one time may later complain of difficulty maintaining sleep, and vice versa. Symptoms of difficulty falling asleep and difficulty maintaining sleep can be quantified by the individual's retrospective self-report, sleep diaries, or other methods, such as actigraphy or polysomnography, but the diagnosis of insomnia disorder is based on the individual's subjective perception of sleep or a caretaker's report. Nonrestorative sleep, a complaint of poor sleep quality that does not leave the individual rested upon awakening despite adequate duration, is a common sleep complaint usually occurring in association with difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep, or less frequently in isolation. This complaint can also be reported in association with other sleep disorders (e. g. , breathing-related sleep disorder). When a complaint of nonrestorative sleep occurs in isolation (i. e. , in the absence of difficulty initiating and/or maintaining sleep) but all diagnostic criteria with regard to frequency, duration, and daytime distress and impairments are otherwise met, a diagnosis of other specified insomnia disorder or unspecified insomnia disorder is made. Aside from the frequency and duration criteria required to make the diagnosis, additional criteria are useful to quantify insomnia severity. These quantitative criteria, while arbitrary, are provided for illustrative purpose only. For instance, difficulty initiating sleep is defined by a subjective sleep latency greater than 20-30 minutes, and difficulty maintaining sleep is defined by a subjective time awake after sleep onset greater than 20-30 minutes. Although there is no standard definition of early-morning awakening, this symptom involves awakening at least 30 minutes before the scheduled time and before total sleep time reaches hours. It is essential to take into account not only the final awakening time but also the bedtime on the previous evening. Awakening at 4:00 A. M. does not have the same clinical significance in those who go to bed at 9:00 P. M. as in those who go to bed at 11:00 P. M. Such a symptom may also reflect an age-dependent decrease in the ability to sustain sleep or an age-dependent shift in the timing of the main sleep period. Insomnia disorder involves daytime impairments as well as nighttime sleep difficulties. These include fatigue or, less commonly, daytime sleepiness; the latter is more common among older individuals and when insomnia is comorbid with another medical condition (e. g. , chronic pain) or sleep disorder (e. g. , sleep apnea). Impairment in cognitive performance may include difficulties with attention, concentration and memory, and even with performing simple manual skills. Associated mood disturbances are typically described as irritability or mood lability and less commonly as depressive or anxiety symptoms. Not all individuals with nighttime sleep disturbances are distressed or have functional impairment. For example, sleep continuity is often interrupted in healthy older adults who nevertheless identify themselves as good sleepers. A diagnosis of insomnia disorder should be reserved for those individuals with significant daytime distress or impairment related to their nighttime sleep difficulties. Recording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis: Insomnia is often associated with physiological and cognitive arousal and conditioning factors that interfere with sleep. A preoccupation with sleep and distress due to the inability to sleep may lead to a vicious cycle: the more the individual strives to sleep, the more frustration builds and further impairs sleep. Thus, excessive attention and efforts to sleep, which override normal sleep-onset mechanisms, may contribute to the development of insomnia. Individuals with persistent insomnia may also acquire maladaptive sleep habits (e. g. , spending excessive time in bed; following an erratic sleep schedule; napping) and cognitions (e. g. , fear of sleeplessness; apprehensions of daytime impairments; clock monitoring) during the course of the disorder. Engaging in such activities in an environment in which the individual has frequently spent sleepless nights may further compound the conditioned arousal and perpetuate sleep difficulties. Conversely, the individual may fall asleep more easily when not trying to do so. Some individuals also report better sleep when away from their own bedrooms and their usual routines. Insomnia may be accompanied by a variety of daytime complaints and symptoms, including fatigue, decreased energy, and mood disturbances. Symptoms of anxiety or depression that do not meet criteria for a specific mental disorder may be present, as well as an excessive focus on the perceived effects of sleep loss on daytime functioning. Individuals with insomnia may have elevated scores on self-report psychological or personality inventories with profiles indicating mild depression and anxiety, a worrisome cognitive style, an emotion-focused and internalizing style of conflict resolution, and a somatic focus. Patterns of neurocognitive impairment among individuals with insomnia disorder are inconsistent, although there may be impairments in performing tasks of higher complexity and those requiring frequent changes in performance strategy. Individuals with insomnia often require more effort to maintain cognitive performance. Prevalence: Population-based estimates indicate that about one-third of adults report insomnia symptoms, 10%-15% experience associated daytime impairments, and 6% -10% have symptoms that meet criteria for insonmia disorder. Insomnia disorder is the most prevalent of all sleep disorders. \u00f9;i primary care settings, approximately 10%-20% of individuals complain of significant insomnia symptoms. Insomnia is a more prevalent complaint among females than among males, with a gender ratio of about 1. 44:1. Although insomnia can be a symptom or an independent disorder, it is most frequently observed as a comorbid condition with another medical condition or mental disorder. For instance, 40%-50% of individuals with insomnia also present with a comorbid mental disorder. Development And Course: The onset of insomnia symptoms can occur at any time during life, but the first episode is more common in young adulthood. Less frequently, insomnia begins in childhood or adolescence. In women, new-onset insomnia may occur during menopause and persist even after other symptoms (e. g. , hot flashes) have resolved. Insomnia may have a late-life onset, which is often associated with the onset of other health-related conditions. Insomnia can be situational, persistent, or recurrent. Situational or acute insomnia usually lasts a few days or a few weeks and is often associated with life events or rapid changes in sleep schedules or environment. It usually resolves once the initial precipitating event subsides. For some individuals, perhaps those more vulnerable to sleep disturbances, insomnia may persist long after the initial triggering event, possibly because of conditioning factors and heightened arousal. The factors that precipitate insomnia may differ from those that perpetuate it. For example, an individual who is bedridden with a painful injury and has difficulty sleeping may then develop negative associations for sleep. Conditioned arousal may then persist and lead to persistent insomnia. A similar course may develop in the context of an acute psychological stress or a mental disorder. For instance, insomnia that occurs during an episode of major depressive disorder can become a focus of attention, with consequent negative conditioning, and persist even after resolution of the depressive episode. In some cases, insomnia may also have an insidious onset without any identifiable precipitating factor. The course of insomnia may also be episodic, with recurrent episodes of sleep difficulties associated with the occurrence of stressful events. Chronicity rates range from 45% to 75% for follow-ups of 1-7 years. Even when the course of the insomnia has become chronic, there is night-to-night variability in sleep patterns, with an occasional restful night's sleep interspersed with several nights of poor sleep. The characteristics of insomnia may also change over time. Many individuals with insomnia have a history of \"light\" or easily disturbed sleep prior to onset of more persistent sleep problems. Insomnia complaints are more prevalent among middle-age and older adults. The type of insomnia symptom changes as a function of age, with difficulties initiating sleep being more common among young adults and problems maintaining sleep occurring more frequently among middle-age and older individuals. Difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep can also occur in children and adolescents, but there are more limited data on prevalence, risk factors, and comorbidity during these developmental phases of the lifespan. Sleep difficulties in childhood can result from conditioning factors (e. g. , a child who does not learn to fall asleep or return to sleep without the presence of a parent) or from the absence of consistent sleep schedules and bedtime routines. Insomnia in adolescence is often triggered or exacerbated by irregular sleep schedules (e. g. , phase delay). In both children and adolescents, psychological and medical factors can contribute to insomnia. The increased prevalence of insomnia in older adults is partly explained by the higher incidence of physical health problems with aging. Changes in sleep patterns associated with the normal developmental process must be differentiated from those exceeding age-related changes. Although polysomnography is of limited value in the routine evaluation of insomnia, it may be more useful in the differential diagnosis among older adults because the etiologies of insomnia (e. g. , sleep apnea) are more often identifiable in older individuals\nRisk And Prognostic Factors: While the risk and prognostic factors discussed in this section increase vuhierability to insomnia, sleep disturbances are more likely to occur when predisposed individuals are exposed to precipitating events, such as major life events (e. g. , illness, separation) or less severe but more chronic daily stress. Most individuals resume normal sleep patterns after the initial triggering event has disappeared, but others\u2014perhaps those more vulnerable to insomnia\u2014continue experiencing persistent sleep difficulties. Perpetuating factors such as poor sleep habits, irregular sleep scheduling, and the fear of not sleeping feed into the insomnia problem and may contribute to a vicious cycle that may induce persistent insomnia. Temperamental. Anxiety or worry-prone personality or cognitive styles, increased arousal predisposition, and tendency to repress emotions can increase vulnerability to insomnia. Environmental. Noise, light, uncomfortably high or low temperature, and high altitude may also increase vulnerability to insomnia. Genetic and physiological. Female gender and advancing age are associated with increased vulnerability to insomnia. Disrupted sleep and insomnia display a familial disposition. The prevalence of insomnia is higher among monozygotic twins relative to dizygotic twins; it is also higher in first-degree family members compared with the general population. The extent to which this link is inherited through a genetic predisposition, learned by observations of parental models, or established as a by-product of another psychopathology remains undetermined. Course modifiers. Deleterious course modifiers include poor sleep hygiene practices (e. g. , excessive caffeine use, irregular sleep schedules)\nCulture Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nGender Related Diagnostic Issues: Insomnia is a more prevalent complaint among females than among males, with first onset often associated with the birth of a new child or with menopause. Despite higher prevalence among older females, polysomnographic studies suggest better preservation of sleep continuity and slow-wave sleep in older females than in older males. Suicide Risk:  \nFunctional Consequences: Interpersonal, social, and occupational problems may develop as a result of insomnia or excessive concern with sleep, increased daytime irritability, and poor concentration. Decreased attention and concentration are common and may be related to higher rates of accidents observed in insomnia. Persistent insomnia is also associated with long-term consequences, including increased risks of major depressive disorder, hypertension, and myocardial infarction; increased absenteeism and reduced productivity at work; reduced quality of life; and increased economic burden\nDiagnostic Markers: Polysomnography usually shows impairments of sleep continuity (e. g. , increased sleep latency and time awake after sleep onset and decreased sleep efficiency [percentage of time in bed asleep] and may show increased stage 1 sleep and decreased stages 3 and 4 sleep. The severity of these sleep impairments does not always match the individual's clinical presentation or subjective complaint of poor sleep, as individuals with insomnia often underestimate sleep duration and overestimate wakefulness relative to polysomnography. Quantitative electroencephalographic analyses may indicate that individuals with insomnia have greater high-frequency electroencephalography power relative to good sleepers both around the sleep onset period and during non-rapid eye movement sleep, a feature suggestive of increased cortical arousal. Individuals with insomnia disorder may have a lower sleep propensity and typically do not show increased daytime sleepiness on objective sleep laboratory measures compared with individuals without sleep disorders. Other laboratory measures show evidence, although not consistently, of increased arousal and a generalized activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (e. g. , increased cortisol levels, heart rate variability, reactivity to stress, metabolic rate). In general, findings are consistent with the hypothesis that increased physiological and cognitive arousal plays a significant role in insomnia disorder. Individuals with insomnia disorder may appear either fatigued or haggard or, conversely, overaroused and \"wired. \" However, there are no consistent or characteristic abnormalities on physical examination. There may be an increased incidence of stress- related psychophysiological symptoms (e. g. , tension headache, muscle tension or pain, gastrointestinal symptoms). Differential Diagnosis: Normal sleep variations. Normal sleep duration varies considerably across individuals. Some individuals who require little sleep (\"short sleepers\") may be concerned about their sleep duration. Short sleepers differ from individuals with insomnia disorder by the lack of difficulty falling or staying asleep and by the absence of characteristic daytime symptoms (e. g. , fatigue, concentration problems, irritability). However, some short sleepers may desire or attempt to sleep for a longer period of time and, by prolonging time in bed, may create an insomnia-like sleep pattern. Clinical insomnia also should be distinguished from normal, age-related sleep changes. Insomnia must also be distinguished from sleep deprivation due to inadequate opportunity or circumstance for sleep resulting, for example, from an emergency or from professional or family obligations forcing the individual to stay awake. Situational/acute insomnia. Situational/acute insomnia is a condition lasting a few days to a few weeks, often associated with life events or with changes in sleep schedules. These acute or short-term insomnia symptoms may also produce significant distress and interfere with social, personal, and occupational functioning. When such symptoms are frequent enough and meet all other criteria except for the 3-month duration, a diagnosis of other specified insomnia disorder or unspecified insomnia disorder is made. Delayed sleep phase and shift work types of circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder. Individuals with the delayed sleep phase type of circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder report sleep-onset insomnia only when they try to sleep at socially normal times, but they do not report difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep when their bed and rising times are delayed and coincide with their endogenous circadian rhythm. Shift work type differs from insomnia disorder by the history of recent shift work. Restless legs syndrome. Restless legs syndrome often produces difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep. However, an urge to move the legs and any accompanying unpleasant leg sensations are features that differentiate this disorder from insomnia disorder. Breathing-related sleep disorders. Most individuals with a breathing-related sleep disorder have a history of loud snoring, breathing pauses during sleep, and excessive daytime sleepiness. Nonetheless, as many as 50% of individuals with sleep apnea may also report insomnia symptoms, a feature that is more common among females and older adults. Narcolepsy. Narcolepsy may cause insomnia complaints but is distinguished from insomnia disorder by the predominance of symptoms of excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, sleep paralysis, and sleep-related hallucinations. Parasomnias. Parasomnias are characterized by a complaint of unusual behavior or events during sleep that may lead to intermittent awakenings and difficulty resuming sleep. However, it is these behavioral events, rather than the insomnia per se, that dominate the clinical picture. Substance/medication-induced sleep disorder, insomnia type. Substance/medicationinduced sleep disorder, insomnia type, is distinguished from insomnia disorder by the fact that a substance (i. e. , a drug of abuse, a medication, or exposure to a toxin) is judged to be etiologically related to the insomnia (see \"Substance/Medication-Induced Sleep Disorder\" later in this chapter). For example, insomnia occurring only in the context of heavy coffee consumption would be diagnosed as caffeine-induced sleep disorder, insomnia type, with onset during intoxication. Comorbidity: Insomnia is a common comorbidity of many medical conditions, including diabetes, coronary heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, arthritis, fibromyalgia, and other chronic pain conditions. The risk relationship appears to be bidirectional: insomnia increases the risk of medical conditions, and medical problems increase the risk of insomnia. The direction of the relationship is not always clear and may change over time; for this reason, comorbid insomnia is the preferred terminology in the presence of coexisting insomnia with another medical condition (or mental disorder). Individuals with insomnia disorder frequently have a comorbid mental disorder, particularly bipolar, depressive, and anxiety disorders. Persistent insomnia represents a risk factor or an early symptom of subsequent bipolar, depressive, anxiety, and substance use disorders. Individuals with insomnia may misuse medications or alcohol to help with nighttime sleep, anxiolytics to combat tension or anxiety, and caffeine or other stimulants to combat excessive fatigue. In addition to worsening the insomnia, this type of substance use may in some cases progress to a substance use disorder\nRelationship To Other Classifications: There are several distinct insomnia phenotypes relating to the perceived source of the insomnia that are recognized by the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd Edition (ICSD-2). These include psychophysiological insomnia, idiopathic insomnia, sleep-state misperception, and inadequate sleep hygiene. Despite their clinical appeal and heuristic value, there is limited evidence to support these distinct phenotypes. .", "Disorder: Hypersomnolence Disorder\nICD-9: 780. 54, ICD-10: G47. 10\nNotes: \nDiagnostic Criteria:\n  A: Self-reported excessive sleepiness (hypersomnolence) despite a main sleep period lasting at least 7 hours, with at least one of the following symptoms:\n    - {'dccd_id': '351', 'dcc_id': '397', 'parent_dccd_id': '0', 'dccd_key': '1', 'dccd_value': 'Recurrent periods of sleep or lapses into sleep within the same day'}\n    - {'dccd_id': '352', 'dcc_id': '397', 'parent_dccd_id': '0', 'dccd_key': '2', 'dccd_value': 'A prolonged main sleep episode of more than 9 hours per day that is nonrestorative (i. e. , unrefreshing).

D: The hypersomnolence is not better explained by and does not occur exclusively during the course of another sleep disorder (e. g. , narcolepsy, breathing-related sleep disorder, circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder, or a parasomnia)\n  E: The hypersomnolence is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e. g. , a drug of abuse, a medication)\n  F: Coexisting mental and medical disorders do not adequately explain the predominant complaint of t^ypersomnolence. Disorder Id: 103\nDiagnostic Features: Hypersomnolence is a broad diagnostic term and includes symptoms of excessive quantity of sleep (e. g. , extended nocturnal sleep or involuntary daytime sleep), deteriorated quality of wakefulness (i. e. , sleep propensity during wakefulness as shown by difficulty awakening or inability to remain awake when required), and sleep inertia (i. e. , a period of impaired performance and reduced vigilance following awakening from the regular sleep episode or from a nap) (Criterion A). Individuals with this disorder fall asleep quickly and have a good sleep efficiency (>90%). They may have difficulty waking up in the morning, sometimes appearing confused, combative, or ataxic. This prolonged impairment of alertness at the sleep-wake transition is often referred to as sleep inertia (i. e. , sleep drunkenness). It can also occur upon awakening from a daytime nap. During that period, the individual appears awake, but there is a decline in motor dexterity, behavior may be very inappropriate, and memory deficits, disorientation in time and space, and feelings of grogginess may occur. This period may last some minutes to hours. The persistent need for sleep can lead to automatic behavior (usually of a very routine, low-complexity type) that the individual carries out with little or no subsequent recall. For example, individuals may find themselves having driven several miles from where they thought they were, unaware of the \"automatic\" driving they did in the preceding minutes. For some individuals with hypersomnolence disorder, the major sleep episode (for most individuals, nocturnal sleep) has a duration of 9 hours or more. However, the sleep is often nonrestorative and is followed by difficulty awakening in the morning. For other individuals with hypersomnolence disorder, the major sleep episode is of normal nocturnal sleep duration (6-9 hours). In these cases, the excessive sleepiness is characterized by several unintentional daytime naps. These daytime naps tend to be relatively long (often lasting 1 hour or more), are experienced as nonrestorative (i. e. , unrefreshing), and do not lead to improved alertness. Individuals with hypersomnolence have daytime naps nearly everyday regardless of the nocturnal sleep duration. Subjective sleep quality may or may not be reported as good. Individuals typically feel sleepiness developing over a period of time, rather than experiencing a sudden sleep \"attack. \" Unintentional sleep episodes typically occur in lowstimulation and low-activity situations (e. g. , while attending lectures, reading, watching television, or driving long distances), but in more severe cases they can manifest in highattention situations such as at work, in meetings, or at social gatherings\nRecording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis: Nonrestorative sleep, automatic behavior, difficulties awakening in the morning, and sleep inertia, although common in hypersomnolence disorder, may also be seen in a variety of conditions, including narcolepsy. Approximately 80% of individuals with hypersomnolence report that their sleep is nonrestorative, and as many have difficulties awakening in the morning. Sleep inertia, though less common (i. e. , observed in 36%-50% of individuals with hypersomnolence disorder), is highly specific to h)\u03c6ersomnolence. Short naps (i. e. , duration of less than 30 minutes) are often unrefreshing. Individuals with hypersomnolence often appear sleepy and may even fall asleep in the clinician's waiting area. A subset of individuals with hypersomnolence disorder have a family history of hypersomnolence and also have symptoms of autonomic nervous system dysfunction, including recurrent vascular-type headaches, reactivity of the peripheral vascular system (Raynaud's phenomenon), and fainting. Prevalence: Approximately 5%-10% of individuals who consult in sleep disorders clinics with complaints of daytime sleepiness are diagnosed as having hypersomnolence disorder. It is estimated that about 1% of the European and U. S. general population has episodes of sleep inertia. Hypersomnolence occurs with relatively equal frequency in males and females. Development And Course: Hypersomnolence disorder has a persistent course, with a progressive evolution in the severity of symptoms. In most extreme cases, sleep episodes can last up to 20 hours. However, the average nighttime sleep duration is around 9Vi hours. While many individuals with hypersomnolence are able to reduce their sleep time during working days, weekend and holiday sleep is greatly increased (by up to 3 hours). Awakenings are very difficult and accompanied by sleep inertia episodes in nearly 40% of cases. Hypersomnolence fully manifests in most cases in late adolescence or early adulthood, with a mean age at onset of 17-24 years. Individuals with hypersomnolence disorder are diagnosed, on average, 10-15 years after the appearance of the first symptoms. Pediatric cases are rare. Hypersomnolence has a progressive onset, with symptoms beginning between ages 15 and 25 years, with a gradual progression over weeks to months. For most individuals, the course is then persistent and stable, unless treatment is initiated. The development of other sleep disorders (e. g. , breathing-related sleep disorder) may worsen the degree of sleepiness. Although hyperactivity may be one of the presenting signs of daytime sleepiness in children, voluntary napping increases with age. This normal phenomenon is distinct from hypersomnolence\nRisk And Prognostic Factors: Environmental. Hypersomnolence can be increased temporarily by psychological stress and alcohol use, but they have not been documented as environmental precipitating factors. Viral infections have been reported to have preceded or accompanied hypersomnolence in about 10% of cases. Viral infections, such as HIV pneumonia, infectious mononucleosis, and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, can also evolve into hypersomnolence within months after the infection. Hypersomnolence can also appear within 6-18 months following a head traum;^. Genetic and physiological. Hypersomnolence may be familial, with an autosomaldominant mode of inheritance. Culture Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nGender Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nSuicide Risk:  \nFunctional Consequences: The low level of alertness that occurs while an individual fights the need for sleep can lead to reduced efficiency, diminished concentration, and poor memory during daytime activities. Hypersomnoience can lead to significant distress and dysfunction in work and social relationships. Prolonged nocturnal sleep and difficulty awakening can result in difficulty in meeting morning obligations, such as arriving at work on time. Unintentional daytime sleep episodes can be embarrassing and even dangerous, if, for instance, the individual is driving or operating machinery when the episode occurs\nDiagnostic Markers: Nocturnal polysomnography demonstrates a normal to prolonged sleep duration, short sleep latency, and normal to increased sleep continuity. The distribution of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is also normal. Sleep efficiency is mostly greater than 90%. Some individuals with hypersomnolence disorder have increased amounts of slow-wave sleep. The multiple sleep latency test documents sleep tendency, typically indicated by mean sleep latency values of less than 8 minutes. In hypersomnolence disorder, the mean sleep latency is typically less than 10 minutes and frequently 8 minutes or less. Sleep-onset REM periods (SOREMPs; i. e. , the occurrence of REM sleep within 20 minutes of sleep onset) may be present but occur less than two times in four to five nap opportunities\nDifferential Diagnosis: Normative variation in sleep. \"Normal\" sleep duration varies considerably in the general population. \"Long sleepers\" (i. e. , individuals who require a greater than average amount of sleep) do not have excessive sleepiness, sleep inertia, or automatic behavior when they obtain their required amount of nocturnal sleep. Sleep is reported to be refreshing. If social or occupational demands lead to shorter nocturnal sleep, daytime symptoms may appear. In hypersomnoience disorder, by contrast, symptoms of excessive sleepiness occur regardless of nocturnal sleep duration. An inadequate amount of nocturnal sleep, or behaviorally induced insufficient sleep syndrome, can produce symptoms of daytime sleepiness very similar to those of hypersomnoience. An average sleep duration of fewer than 7 hours per night strongly suggests inadequate nocturnal sleep, and an average of more than 9-10 hours of sleep per 24-hour period suggests hypersomnoience. Individuals with inadequate nocturnal sleep typically \"catch up\" with longer sleep durations on days when they are free from social or occupational demands or on vacations. Unlike hypersomnoience, insufficient nocturnal sleep is unlikely to persist unabated for decades. A diagnosis of hypersomnoience disorder should not be made if there is a question regarding the adequacy of nocturnal sleep duration. A diagnostic and therapeutic trial of sleep extension for 10-14 days can often clarify the diagnosis. Poor sleep quality and fatigue. Hypersomnoience disorder should be distinguished from excessive sleepiness related to insufficient sleep quantity or quality and fatigue (i. e. , tiredness not necessarily relieved by increased sleep and unrelated to sleep quantity or quality). Excessive sleepiness and fatigue are difficult to differentiate and may overlap considerably. Breathing-related sleep disorders. Individuals with hypersomnoience and breathingrelated sleep disorders may have similar patterns of excessive sleepiness. Breathing- related sleep disorders are suggested by a history of loud snoring, pauses in breathing during sleep, brain injury, or cardiovascular disease and by the presence of obesity, oropharyngeal anatomical abnormalities, hypertension, or heart failure on physical examination. Polysomnographie studies can confirm the presence of apneic events in breathingrelated sleep disorder (and their absence in hypersomnolence disorder). Circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders. Circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders are often characterized by daytime sleepiness. A history of an abnormal sleep-wake schedule (with shifted or irregular hours) is present in individuals with a circadian rhythm sleepwake disorder. Parasomnias. Parasomnias rarely produce the prolonged, undisturbed nocturnal sleep or daytime sleepiness characteristic of hypersomnolence disorder. Other mental disorders. Hypersomnolence disorder must be distinguished from mental disorders that include hypersomnolence as an essential or associated feature. In particular, complaints of daytime sleepiness may occur in a major depressive episode, with atypical features, and in the depressed phase of bipolar disorder. Assessment for other mental disorders is essential before a diagnosis of hypersomnolence disorder is considered. A diagnosis of hypersomnolence disorder can be made in the presence of another current or past mental disorder\nComorbidity: Hypersomnolence can be associated with depressive disorders, bipolar disorders (during a depressive episode), and major depressive disorder, with seasonal pattern. Many individuals with hypersomnolence disorder have symptoms of depression that may meet criteria for a depressive disorder. This presentation may be related to the psychosocial consequences of persistent increased sleep need. Individuals with hyper somnolence disorder are also at risk for substance-related disorders, particularly related to self-medication with stimulants. This general lack of specificity may contribute to very heterogeneous profiles among individuals whose symptoms meet the same diagnostic criteria for hypersomnolence disorder. Neurodegenerative conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and multiple system atrophy, may also be associated with hypersomnolence. Relationship To Other Classifications: The International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd Edition (ICSD-2), differentiates nine subtypes of \"hypersomnias of central origin,\" including recurrent hypersomnia (KleineLevin syndrome). .", "Disorder: Narcolepsy\nICD-9: Variable, ICD-10: Variable\nNotes: \nDiagnostic Criteria:\n  A: Recurrent periods of an irrepressible need to sleep, lapsing into sleep, or napping occurring within the same day.

'}\nDisorder Id: 104\nDiagnostic Features: The essential features of sleepiness in narcolepsy are recurrent daytime naps or lapses into sleep. Sleepiness typically occurs daily but must occur at a minimum three times a week for at least 3 months (Criterion A). Narcolepsy generally produces cataplexy, which most commonly presents as brief episodes (seconds to minutes) of sudden, bilateral loss of muscle tone precipitated by emotions, typically laughing and joking. Muscles affected may include those of the neck, jaw, arms, legs, or whole body, resulting in head bobbing, jaw dropping, or complete falls. Individuals are awake and aware during cataplexy. To meet Criterion Bl(a), cataplexy must be triggered by laughter or joking and must occur at least a few times per month when the condition is untreated or in the past. Cataplexy should not be confused with ''weakness\" occurring in the context of athletic activities (physiological) or exclusively after unusual emotional triggers such as stress or anxiety (suggesting possible psychopathology). Episodes lasting hours or days, or those not triggered by emotions, are unlikely to be cataplexy, nor is rolling on the floor while laughing hysterically. In children close to onset, genuine cataplexy can be atypical, affecting primarily the face, causing grimaces or jaw opening with tongue thrusting (\"cataplectic faces\"). Alternatively, cataplexy may present as low-grade continuous hypotonia, yielding a wobbling walk. In these cases. Criterion Bl(b) can be met in children or in individuals within 6 months of a rapid onset. Narcolepsy-cataplexy nearly always results from the loss of hypothalamic hypocretin (orexin)-producing cells, causing hypocretin deficiency (less than or equal to one-third of control values, or 110 pg/mL in most laboratories). Cell loss is likely autoimmune, and approximately 99% of affected individuals carry HLA-DQBl*06:02 (vs. 12%-38% of control subjects). Thus, checking for the presence of DQB1*06:02 prior to a lumbar puncture for evaluation of CSF hypocretin-1 immunoreactivity may be useful. Rarely, low CSF levels of hypocretin-1 occur without cataplexy, notably in youths who may develop cataplexy later. CSF hypocretin-1 measurement represents the gold standard, excepting associated severe conditions (neurological, inflammatory, infectious, trauma) that can interfere with the assay. A nocturnal polysonrmographic sleep study followed by an MSLT can also be used to confirm the diagnosis (Criterion B3). These tests must be performed after the individual has stopped all psychotropic medications, following 2 weeks of adequate sleep time (as documented with sleep diaries, actigraphy). Short rapid eye movement (REM) latency (sleep-onset REM period, REM latency less than or equal to 15 minutes) during polysomnography is sufficient to confirm the diagnosis and meets Criterion B3. Alternatively, the MSLT result must be positive, showing a mean sleep latency of less than or equal to 8 minutes and two or more sleep-onset REM periods in four to five naps. Recording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis: When sleepiness is severe, automatic behaviors may occur, with the individual continuing his or her activities in a semi-automatic, hazelike fashion without memory or consciousness. Approximately 20%-60% of individuals experience vivid hypnagogic hallucinations before or upon falling asleep or hypnopompic hallucinations just after awakening. These hallucinations are distinct from the less vivid, nonhallucinatory dreamlike mentation at sleep onset that occurs in normal sleepers. Nightmares and vivid dreaming are also frequent in narcolepsy, as is REM sleep behavior disorder. Approximately 20%-60% of individuals experience sleep paralysis upon falling asleep or awakening, leaving them awake but unable to move or speak. However, many normal sleepers also report sleep paralysis, especially with stress or sleep deprivation. Nocturnal eating may occur. Obesity is common. Nocturnal sleep disruption with frequent long or short awakenings is common and can be disabling. Individuals may appear sleepy or fall asleep in the waiting area or during clinical examination. During cataplexy, individuals may slump in a chair and have slurred speech or drooping eyelids. If the clinician has time to check reflexes during cataplexy (most attacks are less than 10 seconds), reflexes are abolished\u2014an important finding distinguishing genuine cataplexy from conversion disorder\nPrevalence: Narcolepsy-cataplexy affects 0. 02%-0. 04% of the general population in most countries. Narcolepsy affects both genders, with possibly a slight male preponderance. Development And Course: Onset is typically in children and adolescents/young adults but rarely in older adults. Two peaks of onset are suggested, at ages 15-25 years and ages 30-35 years. Onset can be abrupt or progressive (over years). Severity is highest when onset is abrupt in children, and then decreases with age or with treatment, so that symptoms such as cataplexy can occasionally disappear. Abrupt onset in young, prepubescent children can be associated with obesity and premature puberty, a phenotype more frequently observed since 2009. In adolescents, onset is more difficult to pinpoint. Onset in adults is often unclear, with some individuals reporting having had excessive sleepiness since birth. Once the disorder has manifested, the course is persistent and lifelong. In 90% of cases, the first symptom to manifest is sleepiness or increased sleep, followed by cataplexy (within 1 year in 50% of cases, within 3 years in 85%). Sleepiness, hypnagogic hallucinations, vivid dreaming, and REM sleep behavior disorder (excessive movements during REM sleep) are early symptoms. Excessive sleep rapidly progresses to an inability to stay awake during the day, and to maintain good sleep at night, without a clear increase in total 24-hour sleep needs. In the first months, cataplexy may be atypical, especially in children. Sleep paralysis usually develops around puberty in children with prepubertal onset. Exacerbations of symptoms suggest lack of compliance with medications or development of a concurrent sleep disorder, notably sleep apnea. Young children and adolescents with narcolepsy often develop aggression or behavioral problems secondary to sleepiness and/or nighttime sleep disruption. Workload and social pressure increase through high school and college, reducing available sleep time at night. Pregnancy does not seem to modify symptoms consistently. After retirement, individuals typically have more opportunity for napping, reducing the need for stimulants. Maintaining a regular schedule benefits individuals at all ages. Risk And Prognostic Factors: Temperamental. Parasomnias, such as sleepwalking, bruxism, REM sleep behavior disorder, and enuresis, may be more common in individuals who develop narcolepsy. Individuals commonly report that they need more sleep than other family members. Environmental. Group A streptococcal throat infection, influenza (notably pandemic H lN l 2009), or other winter infections are likely triggers of the autoimmune process, pro\u00ad ducing narcolepsy a few months later. Head trauma and abrupt changes in sleep-wake patterns (e. g. , job changes, stress) may be additional triggers. Genetic and physiological. Monozygotic twins are 25%-32% concordant for narcolepsy. The prevalence of narcolepsy is l%-2% in first-degree relatives (a 10- to 40-fold increase overall). Narcolepsy is strongly associated with DQB1*06:02 (99% vs. 12%-38% in control subjects of various ethnic groups; 25% in the general U. S. population). DQB1*03:01 increases, while DQBl\u2019OSiOl, DQBl\u2019O\u00f4iOl, and DQB1*06:03 reduce risk in the presence of DQB1\u2019^06:02, but the effect is small. Polymorphisms within the T-cell receptor alpha gene and other immune modulating genes also modulate risk slightly\nCulture Related Diagnostic Issues: Narcolepsy has been described in all ethnic groups and in many cultures. Among African Americans, more cases present without cataplexy or with atypical cataplexy, complicating diagnosis, especially in the presence of obesity and obstructive sleep apnea. Gender Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nSuicide Risk:  \nFunctional Consequences: Driving and working are impaired, and individuals with narcolepsy should avoid jobs that place themselves (e. g. , working with machinery) or others (e. g. , bus driver, pilot) in danger. Once the narcolepsy is controlled with therapy, patients can usually drive, although rarely long distances alone. Untreated individuals are also at risk for social isolation and accidental injury to themselves or others. Social relations may suffer as these individuals strive to avert cataplexy by exerting control over emotions. Diagnostic Markers: Functional imaging suggests impaired hypothalamic responses to humorous stimuli. Nocturnal polysomnography followed by an MSLT is used to confirm the diagnosis of narcolepsy, especially when the disorder is first being diagnosed and before treatment has begun, and if hypocretin deficiency has not been documented biochemically. The polysomnography/MSLT should be performed after the individual is no longer taking any psychotropic drugs and after regular sleep-wake patterns, without shift work or sleep deprivation, have been documented. A sleep-onset REM period during the polysomnography (REM sleep latency less than or equal to 15 minutes) is highly specific (approximately 1% positive in control subjects) but moderately sensitive (approximately 50%). A positive MSLT result displays an average sleep latency of less than or equal to 8 minutes, and sleep-onset REM periods in two or more naps on a four- or five-nap test. The MSLT result is positive in 90%-95% of individuals with narcolepsy versus 2%-4% of control subjects or individuals with other sleep disorders. Additional polysomnographic findings often include frequent arousals, decreased sleep efficiency, and increased stage 1 sleep. Periodic limb movements (found in about 40% of individuals with narcolepsy) and sleep apnea are often noted. Hypocretin deficiency is demonstrated by measuring CSF hypocretin-1 immunoreactivity. The test is particularly useful in individuals with suspected conversion disorder and those without typical cataplexy, or in treatment-refractory cases. The diagnostic value of the test is not affected by medications, sleep deprivation, or circadian time, but the findings are uninte\u03c6retable when the individual is severely ill with a concurrent infection or head trauma or is comatose. CSF cytology, protein, and glucose are within normal range even when sampled within weeks of rapid onset. CSF hypocretin-1 in these incipient cases is typically already very diminished or undetectable\nDifferential Diagnosis: Other hypersomnias. Hypersomnolence and narcolepsy are similar with respect to the degree of daytime sleepiness, age at onset, and stable course over time but can be distin\u00ad guished based on distinctive clinical and laboratory features. Individuals with hypersomnolence typically have longer and less disrupted nocturnal sleep, greater difficulty awakening, more persistent daytime sleepiness (as opposed to more discrete \"sleep attacks\" in narcolepsy), longer and less refreshing daytime sleep episodes, and little or no dreaming during daytime naps. By contrast, individuals with narcolepsy have cataplexy and recurrent intrusions of elements of REM sleep into the transition between sleep and wakefulness (e. g. , sleep-related hallucinations and sleep paralysis). The MSLT typically demonstrates shorter sleep latencies (i. e. , greater physiological sleepiness) as well as the presence of multiple sleep-onset REM periods in individuals with narcolepsy. Sleep deprivation and insufficient nocturnal sleep. Sleep deprivation and insufficient nocturnal sleep are common in adolescents and shift workers. In adolescents, difficulties falling asleep at night are common, causing sleep deprivation. The MSLT result may be positive if conducted while the individual is sleep deprived or while his or her sleep is phase delayed. Sleep apnea syndromes. Sleep apneas are especially likely in the presence of obesity. Because obstructive sleep apnea is more frequent than narcolepsy, cataplexy may be overlooked (or absent), and the individual is assumed to have obstructive sleep apnea unresponsive to usual therapies. Major depressive disorder. Narcolepsy or hypersomnia may be associated or confused with depression. Cataplexy is not present in depression. The MSLT results are most often normal, and there is dissociation between subjective and objective sleepiness, as measured by the mean sleep latency during the MSLT. Conversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder). Atypical features, such as long-lasting cataplexy or unusual triggers, may be present in conversion disorder (functional neurological symptom disorder). Individuals may report sleeping and dreaming, yet the MSLT does not show the characteristic sleep-onset REM period. Full-blown, long-lasting pseudocataplexy may occur during consultation, allowing the examining physician enough time to verify reflexes, which remain intact. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder or other behavioral problems. In children and adolescents, sleepiness can cause behavioral problems, including aggressiveness and inattention, leading to a misdiagnosis of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Seizures. In young children, cataplexy can be misdiagnosed as seizures. Seizures are not conmionly triggered by emotions, and when they are, the trigger is not usually laughing or joking. During a seizure, individuals are more likely to hurt themselves when falling. Seizures characterized by isolated atonia are rarely seen in isolation of other seizures, and they also have signatures on the electroencephalogram. Chorea and movement disorders. In young children, cataplexy can be misdiagnosed as chorea or pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections, especially in the context of a strep throat infection and high antistreptolysin O antibody levels. Some children may have an overlapping movement disorder close to onset of the cataplexy. Schizophrenia. In the presence of florid and vivid hypnagogic hallucinations, individuals may think these experiences are real\u2014a feature that suggests schizophrenia. Similarly, with stimulant treatment, persecutory delusions may develop. If cataplexy is present, the clinician should first assume that these symptoms are secondary to narcolepsy before considering a co-occurring diagnosis of schizophrenia. Comorbidity: Narcolepsy can co-occur with bipolar, depressive, and anxiety disorders, and in rare cases with schizophrenia. Narcolepsy is also associated with increased body mass index or obe\u00ad sity, especially when the narcolepsy is untreated. Rapid weight gain is common in young children with a sudden disease onset. Comorbid sleep apnea should be considered if there is a sudden aggravation of preexisting narcolepsy. Relationship To Other Classifications: The International Classification of Sleep Disorders, 2nd Edition (ICSD-2), differentiates five subtypes of narcolepsy.

C: The symptoms in Criterion A cause clinically significant distress in the individual\n  D: The sexual dysfunction is not better explained by a nonsexual mental disorder or as a consequence of severe relationship distress or other significant stressors and is not attributable to the effects of a substance/medication or another medical condition\nDisorder Id: 120\nDiagnostic Features: The distinguishing feature of delayed ejaculation is a marked delay in or inability to achieve ejaculation (Criterion A). The man reports difficulty or inability to ejaculate despite the presence of adequate sexual stimulation and the desire to ejaculate. The presenting complaint usually involves partnered sexual activity. In most cases, the diagnosis will be made by self-report of the individual. The definition of \"delay\" does not have precise boundaries, as there is noconsensus as to what constitutes a reasonable time to reach orgasm or what is unacceptably long for most men and their sexual partners. Recording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis: The man and his partner may report prolonged thrusting to achieve orgasm to the point of exhaustion or genital discomfort and then ceasing efforts. Some men may report avoiding sexual activity because of a repetitive pattern of difficulty ejaculating. Some sexual partners may report feeliAg less sexually attractive because their partner cannot ejaculate easily. In addition to the subtypes \"lifelong/acquired\" and \"generalized/situational,\" the following five factors must be considered during assessment and diagnosis of delayed ejaculation, given that they may be relevant to etiology and/or treatment: 1) partner factors (e. g. , partner's sexual problems, partner's health status); 2) relationship factors (e. g. , poor communication, discrepancies in desire for sexual activity); 3) individual vulnerability factors (e. g. , poor body image; history of sexual or emotional abuse), psychiatric comorbidity (e. g. , depression, anxiety), or stressors (e. g. , job loss, bereavement); 4) cultural/religious factors (e. g. , inhibitions related to prohibitions against sexual activity; attitudes toward sexuality); and 5) medical factors relevant to prognosis, course, or treatment. Each of these factors may contribute differently to the presenting symptoms of different men with this disorder. Prevalence: Prevalence is unclear because of the lack of a precise definition of this syndrome. It is the least common male sexual complaint. Only 75% of men report always ejaculating during sexual activity, and less than 1% of men will complain of problems with reaching ejaculation that last more than 6 months. Development And Course: Lifelong delayed ejaculation begins with early sexual experiences and continues throughout life. By definition, acquired delayed ejaculation begins after a period of normal sexual function. There is minimal evidence concerning the course of acquired delayed ejaculation. The prevalence of delayed ejaculation appears to remain relatively constant until around age 50 years, when the incidence begins to increase significantly. Men in their 80s report twice as much difficulty ejaculating as men younger than 59 years\nRisk And Prognostic Factors: Genetic and physiological. Age-related loss of the fast-conducting peripheral sensory nerves and age-related decreased sex steroid secretion may be associated with the increase in delayed ejaculation in men older than 50 years\nCulture Related Diagnostic Issues: Complaints of ejaculatory delay vary across countries and cultures. Such complaints are more common among men in Asian populations than in men living in Europe, Australia, or the United States. This variation may be attributable to cultural or genetic differences between cultures\nGender Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nSuicide Risk:  \nFunctional Consequences: Difficulty with ejaculation may contribute to difficulties in conception. Delayed ejaculation is often associated with considerable psychological distress in one or both partners. Diagnostic Markers:  \nDifferential Diagnosis: Another medical condition. The major differential diagnosis is between delayed ejaculation fully explained by another medical illness or injury and delayed ejaculation with a psychogenic, idiopathic, or combined psychological and medical etiology. A situational aspect to the complaint is suggestive of a psychological basis for the problem (e. g. , men who can ejaculate during sexual activity with one sex but not the other; men who can ejaculate with one partner but not another of the same sex; men with paraphilic arousal pat\u00ad terns; men who require highly ritualized activity to ejaculate during partnered sexual activity). Another medical illness or injury may produce delays in ejaculation independent of psychological issues. For example, inability to ejaculate can be caused by interruption of the nerve supply to the genitals, such as can occur after traumatic surgical injury to the lumbar sympathetic ganglia, abdominoperitoneal surgery, or lumbar sympathectomy. Ejaculation is thought to be under autonomic nervous system control involving the hypogastric (sympathetic) and pudendal (parasympathetic) nerves. A number of neurodegenerative diseases, such as multiple sclerosis and diabetic and alcoholic neuropathy, can cause inability to ejaculate. Delayed ejaculation should also be differentiated from retrograde ejaculation (i. e. , ejaculation into the bladder), which may follow transurethral prostatic resection. Substance/medication use. A number of pharmacological agents, such as antidepressants, antipsychotics, alpha sympathetic drugs, and opioid drugs, can cause ejaculatory problems. Dysfunction with orgasm. It is important in the history to ascertain whether the complaint concerns delayed ejaculation or the sensation of orgasm, or both. Ejaculation occurs in the genitals, whereas the experience of orgasm is believed to be primarily subjective. Ejaculation and orgasm usually occur together but not always. For example, a man with a normal ejaculatory pattern may complain of decreased pleasure (i. e. , anhedonic ejaculation). Such a complaint would not be coded as delayed ejaculation but could be coded as other specified sexual dysfunction or unspecified sexual dysfunction. Comorbidity: There is some evidence to suggest that delayed ejaculation may be more common in severe forms of major depressive disorder. Relationship To Other Classifications:.", "Disorder: Erectile Disorder\nICD-9: 302. 72, ICD-10: F52. 21\nNotes: \nDiagnostic Criteria:\n  A: At least one of the three following symptoms must be experienced on almost all or all (approximately 75%-100%) occasions of sexual activity (in identified situational contexts or, if generalized, in all contexts):\n  B: The symptoms in Criterion A have persisted for a minimum duration of approximately 6 months\n  C: The symptoms in Criterion A cause clinically significant distress in the individual. D: The sexual dysfunction is not better explained by a nonsexual mental disorder or as a consequence of severe relationship distress or other significant stressors and is not attributable to the effects of a substance/medication or another medical condition\nDisorder Id: 121\nDiagnostic Features: The essential feature of erectile disorder is the repeated failure to obtain or maintain erections during partnered sexual activities (Criterion A). A careful sexual history is necessary to ascertain that the problem has been present for a significant duration of time (i. e. , at least approximately 6 months) and occurs on the majority of sexual occasions (i. e. , at least 75% of the time). Symptoms may occur only in specific situations involving certain types of stimulation or partners, or they may occur in a generalized manner in all types of situations, stimulation, or partners. Recording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis: Many men with erectile disorder may have low self-esteem, low self-confidence, and a decreased sense of masculinity, and may experience depressed affect. Fear and/or avoidance of future sexual encounters may occur. Decreased sexual satisfaction and reduced sexual desire in the individual's partner are common. In addition to the subtypes \"lifelong/acquired\" and \"generalized/situational,\" the following five factors must be considered during assessment and diagnosis of erectile disorder given that they may be relevant to etiology and/or treatment: 1) partner factors (e. g. , partner's sexual problems, partner's health status); 2) relationship factors (e. g. , poor communication, discrepancies in desire for sexual activity); 3) individual vulnerability factors (e. g. , poor body image, history of sexual or emotional abuse), psychiatric comorbidity (e. g. , depression, anxiety), or stressors (e. g. , job loss, bereavement); 4) cultural/religious factors (e. g. , inhibitions related to prohibitions against sexual activity; attitudes toward sexuality); and 5) medical factors relevant to prognosis, course, or treatment. Each of these factors may contribute differentiy to the presenting symptoms of different men with this disorder. Prevalence: The prevalence of lifelong versus acquired erectile disorder is unknown. There is a strong age-related increase in both prevalence and incidence of problems with erection, particularly after age 50 years. Approximately 13%-21% of men ages 40-80 years complain of occasional problems with erections. Approximately 2% of men younger than age 40-50 years complain of frequent problems with erections, whereas 40%-50% of men older than 60-70 years may have significant problems with erections. About 20% of men fear erectile problems on their first sexual experience, whereas approximately 8% experienced erectile problems that hindered penetration during their first sexual experience\nDevelopment And Course: Erectile failure on first sexual attempt has been found to be related to having sex with a previously unknown partner, concomitant use of drugs or alcohol, not wanting to have sex, and peer pressure. There is minimal evi-2t most of these problems spontaneously remit without professional intervention, but some men may continue to have episodic problems. In contrast, acquired erectile disorder is often associated with biological factors such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Acquired erectile disorder is likely to be persistent in most men. The natural history of lifelong erectile disorder is unknown. Clinical observation supports the association of lifelong erectile disorder with psychological factors that are self- limiting or responsive to psychological interventions, whereas, as noted above, acquired erectile disorder is more likely to be related to biological factors and to be persistent. The incidence of erectile disorder increases with age. A minority of men diagnosed as having moderate erectile failure may experience spontaneous remission of symptoms without medical intervention. Distress associated with erectile disorder is lower in older men as compared with younger men. Risk And Prognostic Factors: Temperamental. Neurotic personality traits may be associated with erectile problems in college students, and submissive personality traits may be associated with erectile problems in men age 40 years and older. Alexithymia (i. e. , deficits in cognitive processing of emotions) is common in men diagnosed with \"psychogenic\" erectile dysfunction. Erectile problems are common in men diagnosed with depression and posttraumatic stress disorder. Course modifiers. Risk factors for acquired erectile disorder include age, smoking tobacco, lack of physical exercise, diabetes, and decreased desire\nCulture Related Diagnostic Issues: Complaints of erectile disorder have been found to vary across countries. It is unclear to what extent these differences represent differences in cultural expectations as opposed to genuine differences in the frequency of erectile failure. Gender Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nSuicide Risk:  \nFunctional Consequences: Erectile disorder can interfere with fertility and produce both individual and interpersonal distress. Fear and/or avoidance of sexual encounters may interfere with the ability to develop intimate relationships\nDiagnostic Markers: Nocturnal penile tumescence testing and measured erectile turgidity during sleep can be employed to help differentiate organic from psychogenic erectile problems on the assumption that adequate erections during rapid eye movement sleep indicate a psychological etiology to the problem. A number of other diagnostic procedures may be employed depending on the clinician's assessment of their relevance given the individual's age, comorbid medical problems, and clinical presentation. Doppler ultrasonography and intravascular injection of vasoactive drugs, as well as invasive diagnostic procedures such as dynamic infusion cavernosography, can be used to assess vascular integrity. Pudendal nerve conduction studies, including somatosensory evoked potentials, can be employed when a peripheral neuropathy is suspected. In men also complaining of decreased sexual desire, serum bioavailable or free testosterone is frequently assessed to determine if the difficulty is secondary to endocrinological factors. Thyroid function may also be assessed. Determination of fasting serum glucose is useful to screen for the presence of diabetes mellitus. The assessment of serum lipids is important, as erectile disorder in men 40 years and older is predictive of the future risk of coronary artery disease. Differential Diagnosis: Nonsexual mental disordei^. Major depressive disorder and erectile disorder are closely associated, and erectile disorder accompanying severe depressive disorder may occur. Normal erectile function. The differential should include consideration of normal erectile function in men with excessive expectations. Substance/medication use. Another major differential diagnosis is whether the erectile problem is secondary to substance/medication use. An onset that coincides with the beginning of substance/medication use and that dissipates with discontinuation of the substance/medication or dose reduction is suggestive of a substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction. Another medical condition. The most difficult aspect of the differential diagnosis of erectile disorder is ruling out erectile problems that are fully explained by medical factors. Such cases would not receive a diagnosis of a mental disorder. The distinction between erectile disorder as a mental disorder and erectile dysfunction as the result of another medical condition is usually unclear, and many cases will have complex, interactive biological and psychiatric etiologies. If the individual is older than 40-50 years and/or has concomitant medical problems, the differential diagnosis should include medical etiologies, especially vascular disease. The presence of an organic disease known to cause erectile problems does not confirm a causal relationship. For example, a man with diabetes mellitus can develop erectile disorder in response to psychological stress. In general, erectile dysfunction due to organic factors is generalized and gradual in onset. An exception would be erectile problems after traumatic injury to the nervous innervation of the genital organs (e. g. , spinal cord injury). Erectile problems that are situational and inconsistent and that have an acute onset after a stressful life event are most often due to psychological events. An age of less than 40 years is also suggestive of a psychological etiology to the difficulty. Other sexual dysfunctions. Erectile disorder may coexist with premature (early) ejaculation and male hypoactive sexual desire disorder. Comorbidity: Erectile disorder can be comorbid with other sexual diagnoses, such as premature (early) ejaculation and male hypoactive sexual desire disorder, as well as with anxiety and depressive disorders. Erectile disorder is common in men with lower urinary tract symptoms related to prostatic hypertrophy. Erectile disorder may be comorbid with dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disease, hypogonadism, multiple sclerosis, diabetes mellitus, and other diseases that interfere with the vascular, neurological, or endocrine function necessary for normal erectile function. Relationship To Other Classifications: Erectile response is coded as failure of genital response in ICD-10 (F2. 2). .", "Disorder: Female Orgasmic Disorder\nICD-9: 302. 73, ICD-10: F52. 31\nNotes: \nDiagnostic Criteria:\n  A: Presence of either of the following symptoms and experienced on almost all or all (approximately 75%-100%) occasions of sexual activity (in identified situational contexts or, if generalized, in all contexts)\n    - {'dccd_id': '374', 'dcc_id': '451', 'parent_dccd_id': '0', 'dccd_key': '1', 'dccd_value': 'Marked delay in, marked infrequency of, or absence of orgasm'}\n    - {'dccd_id': '375', 'dcc_id': '451', 'parent_dccd_id': '0', 'dccd_key': '2', 'dccd_value': 'Markedly reduced intensity of orgasmic sensations. '}\n  B: The symptoms in Criterion A have persisted for a minimum duration of approximately 6 months\n  C: The symptoms in Criterion A cause clinically significant distress in the individual. D: The sexual dysfunction is not better explained by a nonsexual mental disorder or as a consequence of severe relationship distress (e. g. , partner violence) or other significant stressors and is not attributable to the effects of a substance/medication or another medical condition\nDisorder Id: 122\nDiagnostic Features: Female orgasmic disorder is characterized by difficulty experiencing orgasm and/or markedly reduced intensity of orgasmic sensations (Criterion A). Women show wide variability in the type or intensity of stimulation that elicits orgasm. Similarly, subjective descriptions of orgasm are extremely varied, suggesting that it is experienced in very different ways, both across women and on different occasions by the same woman. For a diagnosis of female orgasmic disorder, symptoms must be experienced on almost all or all (approximately 75%-100%) occasions of sexual activity (in identified situational contexts or, if generalized, in all contexts) and have a minimum duration of approximately 6 months. The use of the minimum severity and duration criteria is intended to distinguish transient orgasm difficulties from more persistent orgasmic dysfunction. The inclusion of \"approximately\" in Criterion B allows for clinician judgment in cases in which symptom duration does not meet the recommended 6-month threshold. For a woman to have a diagnosis of female orgasmic disorder, clinically significant distress must accompany the symptoms (Criterion C). In many cases of orgasm problems, the causes are multifactorial or cannot be determined. If female orgasmic disorder is deemed to be better explained by another mental disorder, the effects of a substance/medication, or a medical condition, then a diagnosis of female orgasmic disorder would not be made. Finally, if interpersonal or significant contextual factors, such as severe relationship distress, intimate partner violence, or other significant stressors, are present, then a diagnosis of female orgasmic disorder would not be made. Many women require clitoral stimulation to reach orgasm, and a relatively small proportion of women report that they always experience orgasm during penile-vaginal intercourse. Thus, a woman's experiencing orgasm through clitoral stimulation but not during intercourse does not meet criteria for a clinical diagnosis of female orgasmic disorder. It is also important to consider whether orgasmic difficulties are the result of inadequate sexual stimulation; in these cases, there may still be a need for care, but a diagnosis of female orgasmic disorder would not be made. Recording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis: Associations between specific patterns of personality traits or psychopathology and orgasmic dysfunction have generally not been supported. Compared with women without the disorder, some women with female orgasmic disorder may have greater difficulty communicating about sexual issues. Overall sexual satisfaction, however, is not strongly correlated with orgasmic experience. Many women report high levels of sexual satisfaction despite rarely or never experiencing orgasm. Orgasmic difficulties in women often cooccur with problems related to sexual interest and arousal. In addition to the subtypes \"lifelong/acquired\" and \"generalized/situational/' the following five factors must be considered during assessment and diagnosis of female orgasmic disorder given that they may be relevant to etiology and/or treatment: 1) partner factors (e. g. , partner's sexual problems, partner's health status); 2) relationship factors (e. g. , poor communication, discrepancies in desire for sexual activity); 3) individual vulnerability factors (e. g. , poor body image, history of sexual or emotional abuse), psychiatric comorbidity (e. g. , depression, anxiety), or stressors (e. g. , job loss, bereavement); (4) cultural/religious factors (e. g. , inhibitions related to prohibitions against sexual activity; attitudes toward sexuality); and 5) medical factors relevant to prognosis, course, or treatment. Each of these factors may contribute differently to the presenting symptoms of different women with this disorder. Prevalence: Reported prevalence rates for female orgasmic problems in women vary widely, from 10% to 42%, depending on multiple factors (e. g. , age, culture, duration, and severity of symptoms); however, these estimates do not take into account the presence of distress. Only a proportion of women experiencing orgasm difficulties also report associated distress. Variation in how symptoms are assessed (e. g. , the duration of symptoms and the recall period) also influence prevalence rates. Approximately 10% of women do not experience orgasm throughout their lifetime. Development And Course: By definition, lifelong female orgasmic disorder indicates that the orgasmic difficulties have always been present, whereas the acquired subtype would be assigned if the woman's orgasmic difficulties developed after a period of normal orgasmic functioning. A woman's first experience of orgasm can occur any time from the prepubertal period to well into adulthood. Women show a more variable pattern in age at first orgasm than do men, and women's reports of having experienced orgasm increase with age. Many women learn to experience orgasm as they experience a wide variety of stimulation and acquire more knowledge about their bodies. Women's rates of orgasm consistency (defined as \"usually or always\" experiencing orgasm) are higher during masturbation than during sexual activity with a partner\nRisk And Prognostic Factors: Temperamental. A wide range of psychological factors, such as anxiety and concerns about pregnancy, can potentially interfere with a woman's ability to experience orgasm. Environmental. There is a strong association between relationship problems, physical health, and mental health and orgasm difficulties in women. Sociocultural factors (e. g. , gender role expectations and religious norms) are also important influences on the experience of orgasmic difficulties. Genetic and physiological. Many physiological factors may influence a woman's experience of orgasm, including medical conditions and medications. Conditions such as multiple sclerosis, pelvic nerve damage from radical hysterectomy, and spinal cord injury can all influence orgasmic functioning in women. Selective serotonin reuptake ir\u00fciibitors are known to delay or inhibit orgasm in women. Women with vulvovaginal atrophy (characterized by symptoms such as vaginal dryness, itching, and pain) are significantly more likely to report orgasm difficulties than are women without this condition. Menopausal status is not consistently associated with the likelihood of orgasm difficulties. There may be a significant genetic contribution to variation in female orgasmic function. However, psychological, sociocultural, and physiological factors likely interact in complex ways to influence women's experience of orgasm and of orgasm difficulties\nCulture Related Diagnostic Issues: The degree to which lack of orgasm in women is regarded as a problem that requires treatment may vary depending on cultural context. In addition, women differ in how important orgasm is to their sexual satisfaction. There may be marked sociocultural and generational differences in women's orgasmic ability. For example, the prevalence of inability to reach orgasm has ranged from 17. 7% (in Northern Europe) to 42. 2% (in Southeast Asia)\nGender Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nSuicide Risk:  \nFunctional Consequences: The functional consequences of female orgasmic disorder are unclear. Although there is a strong association between relationship problems and orgasmic difficulties in women, it is unclear whether relationship factors are risk factors for orgasmic difficulties or are consequences of those difficulties. Diagnostic Markers: Although measurable physiological changes occur during female orgasm, including changes in hormones, pelvic floor musculature, and brain activation, there is significant variability in these indicators of orgasm across women. In clinical situations, the diagnosis of female orgasmic disorder is based on a woman's self-report. Differential Diagnosis: Nonsexual mental disorders. Nonsexual mental disorders, such as major depressive disorder, which is characterized by markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities, may explain female orgasmic disorder. If the orgasmic difficulties are better explained by another mental disorder, then a diagnosis of female orgasmic disorder would not be made. Substance/nfiedlcation-induced sexual dysfunction. Substance/medication use may explain the orgasmic difficulties. Another medical condition. If the disorder is due to another medical condition (e. g. , multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury), then a diagnosis of female orgasmic disorder would not be made. Interpersonal factors. If interpersonal or significant contextual factors, such as severe relationship distress, intimate partner violence, or other significant stressors, are associated with the orgasmic difficulties, then a diagnosis of female orgasmic disorder would not be made. Other sexual dysfunctions. Female orgasmic disorder may occur in association with other sexual dysfunctions (e. g. , female sexual interest/arousal disorder). The presence of another sexual dysfunction does not rule out a diagnosis of female orgasmic disorder. Occasional orgasmic difficulties that are short-term or infrequent and are not accompanied by clinically significant distress or impairment are not diagnosed as female orgasmic disorder. A diagnosis is also not appropriate if the problems are the result of inadequate sexual stimulation. Comorbidity: Women with female orgasmic disorder may have co-occurring sexual interest/arousal difficulties. Women with diagnoses of other nonsexual mental disorders, such as major depressive disorder, may experience lower sexual interest/arousal, and this may indirectly increase the likelihood of orgasmic difficulties. Relationship To Other Classifications:.", "Disorder: Female Sexual Interest/Arousal Disorder\nICD-9: 302. 72, ICD-10: F52. 22\nNotes: \nDiagnostic Criteria:\n  A: Lack of, or significantly reduced, sexual interest/arousal, as manifested by at least three of the following:\n    - {'dccd_id': '376', 'dcc_id': '455', 'parent_dccd_id': '0', 'dccd_key': '1', 'dccd_value': 'Absent/reduced interest in sexual activity.

'}\n  B: The symptoms in Criterion A have persisted for a minimum duration of approximately 6 months. C: The symptoms in Criterion A cause clinically significant distress in the individual. D: The sexual dysfunction is not better explained by a nonsexuai mental disorder or as a consequence of severe relationship distress (e. g. , partner violence) or other significant stressors and is not attributable to the effects of a substance/medication or another medical condition\nDisorder Id: 123\nDiagnostic Features: In assessing female sexual interest/arousal disorder, interpersonal context must be taken into account. A \"desire discrepancy,\" in which a woman has lower desire for sexual activity than her partner, is not sufficient to diagnose female sexual interest/arousal disorder. In order for the criteria for the disorder to be met, there must be absence or reduced frequency or intensity of at least three of six indicators (Criterion A) for a minimum duration of approximately 6 months (Criterion B). There may be different symptom profiles across women, as well as variability in how sexual interest and arousal are expressed. For example, in one woman, sexual interest/arousal disorder may be expressed as a lack of interest in sexual activity, an absence of erotic or sexual thoughts, and reluctance to initiate sexual activity and respond to a partner's sexual invitations. In another woman, an inability to become sexually excited, to respond to sexual stimuli with sexual desire, and a correspond- ing lack of signs of physical sexual arousal may be the primary features. Because sexual desire and arousal frequently coexist and are elicited in response to adequate sexual cues, the criteria for female sexual interest/arousal disorder take into account that difficulties in desire and arousal often simultaneously characterize the complaints of women with this disorder. Short-term changes in sexual interest or arousal are common and may be adaptive responses to events in a woman's life and do not represent a sexual dysfunction. Diagnosis of female sexual interest/arousal disorder requires a minimum duration of symptoms of approximately 6 months as a reflection that the symptoms must be a persistent problem. The estimation of persistence may be determined by clinical judgment when a duration of 6 months cannot be ascertained precisely. There may be absent or reduced frequency or intensity of interest in sexual activity (Criterion Al), which was previously termed hypoactive sexual desire disorder. The frequency or intensity of sexual and erotic thoughts or fantasies may be absent or reduced (Criterion A2). The expression of fantasies varies widely across women and may include memories of past sexual experiences. The normative decline in sexual thoughts with age should be taken into account when this criterion is being assessed. Absence or reduced frequency of initiating sexual activity and of receptivity to a partner's sexual invitations (Criterion A3) is a behaviorally focused criterion. A couple's beliefs and preferences for sexual initiation patterns are highly relevant to the assessment of this criterion. There may be absent or reduced sexual excitement or pleasure during sexual activity in almost all or all (approximately 75%-100%) sexual encounters (Criterion A4). Lack of pleasure is a common presenting clinical complaint in women with low desire. Among women who report low sexual desire, there are fewer sexual or erotic cues that elicit sexual interest or arousal (i. e. , there is a lack of \"responsive desire\"). Assessment of the adequacy of sexual stimuli will assist in determining if there is a difficulty with responsive sexual desire (Criterion A5). Frequency or intensity of genital or nongenital sensations during sexual activity may be reduced or absent (Criterion A6). This may include reduced vaginal lubrication/vasocongestion, but because physiological measures of genital sexual response do not differentiate women who report sexual arousal concerns from those who do not, the selfreport of reduced or absent genital or nongenital sensations is sufficient. For a diagnosis of female sexual interest/arousal disorder to be made, clinically significant distress must accompany the symptoms in Criterion A. Distress may be experienced as a result of the lack of sexual interest Arousal or as a result of significant interference in a woman's life and well-being. If a lifelong lack of sexual desire is better explained by one's self-identification as \"asexual,\" then a diagnosis of female sexual interest/arousal disorder would not be made. Recording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis: Female sexual interest/arousal disorder is frequently associated with problems in experiencing orgasm, pain experienced during sexual activity, infrequent sexual activity, and couple-level discrepancies in desire. Relationship difficulties and mood disorders are also frequently associated features of female sexual interest/arousal disorder. Unrealistic expectations and norms regarding the \"appropriate\" level of sexual interest or arousal, along with poor sexual techniques and lack of information about sexuality, may also be evident in women diagnosed with female sexual interest/arousal disorder. The latter, as well as normative beliefs about gender roles, are important factors to consider. In addition to the subtypes \"lifelong/acquired\" and \"generalized/situational,\" the following five factors must be considered during assessment and diagnosis of female sexual interest/ arousal disorder given that they may be relevant to etiology and/or treatment: 1) partner factors (e. g. , partner's sexual problems, partner's health status); 2) relationship factors (e. g. , poor communication, discrepancies in desire for sexual activity); 3) individual vulnerability factors (e. g. , poor body image, history of sexual or emotional abuse), psychiatric comorbidity (e. g. , depression, anxiety), or stressors (e. g. , job loss, bereavement); 4) cultural/religious factors (e. g. , inhibitions related to prohibitions against sexual activity; attitudes toward sexuality); and 5) medical factors relevant to prognosis, course, or treatment. Note that each of these factors may contribute differently to the presenting symptoms of different women with this disorder. Prevalence: The prevalence of female sexual interest/arousal disorder, as defined in this manual, is unknown. The prevalence of low sexual desire and of problems with sexual arousal (with and without associated distress), as defined by DSM-IV or ICD-10, may vary markedly in relation to age, cultural setting, duration of symptoms, and presence of distress. Regarding duration of symptoms, there are striking differences in prevalence estimates between short-term and persistent problems related to lack of sexual interest. When distress about sexual functioning is required, prevalence estimates are markedly lower. Some older women report less distress about low sexual desire than younger women, although sexual desire may decrease with age. Development And Course: By definition, lifelong female sexual interest/arousal disorder suggests that the lack of sexual interest or arousal has been present for the woman's entire sexual life. For Criteria A3, A4, and A6, which assess functioning during sexual activity, a subtype of lifelong would mean presence of symptoms since the individual's first sexual experiences. The acquired subtype would be assigned if the difficulties with sexual interest or arousal developed after a period of nonproblematic sexual functioning. Adaptive and normative changes in sexual functioning may result from partner-related, interpersonal, or personal events and may be transient in nature. However, persistence of symptoms for approximately 6 months or more would constitute a sexual dysfunction. There are normative changes in sexual interest and arousal across the life span. Furthermore, women in relationships of longer duration are more likely to report engaging in sex despite no obvious feelings of sexual desire at the outset of a sexual encounter compared with women in shorter-duration relationships. Vaginal dryness in older women is related to age and menopausal status. Risk And Prognostic Factors: Temperamental. Temperamental factors include negative cognitions and attitudes about sexuality and past history of mental disorders. Differences in propensity for sexual excitation and sexual inhibition may also predict the likelihood of developing sexual problems. Environmental. Environmental factors include relationship difficulties, partner sexual functioning, and developmental history, such as early relationships with caregivers and childhood stressors. Genetic and physiological. Some medical conditions (e. g. , diabetes mellitus, thyroid dysfunction) can be risk factors for female sexual interest/arousal disorder. There appears to be a strong influence of genetic factors on vulnerability to sexual problems in women. Psychophysiological research using vaginal photoplethysmography has not found differences between women with and without perceived lack of genital arousal. Culture Related Diagnostic Issues: There is marked variability in prevalence rates of low desire across cultures. Lower rates of sexual desire may be more common among East Asian women compared with EuroCanadian women. Although the lower levels of sexual desire and arousal found in men and women from East Asian countries compared with Euro-American groups may reflect less interest in sex in those cultures, the possibility remains that such group differences are an artifact of the measures used to quantify desire. A judgment about whether low sexual desire reported by a woman from a certain ethnocultural group meets criteria for female sexual interest/arousal disorder must take into account the fact that different cultures may pathologize some behaviors and not others\nGender Related Diagnostic Issues: By definition, the diagnosis of female sexual interest/arousal disorder is only given to women. Distressing difficulties with sexual desire in men would be considered under male hypoactive sexual desire disorder. Suicide Risk:  \nFunctional Consequences: Difficulties in sexual interest/arousal are often associated with decreased relationship satisfaction. Diagnostic Markers:  \nDifferential Diagnosis: Nonsexual mental disorders. Nonsexual mental disorders, such as major depressive disorder, in which there is '\"markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of the day, nearly every day,\" may explain the lack of sexual interest/ arousal. If the lack of interest or arousal is completely attributable to another mental disorder, then a diagnosis of female sexual interest/arousal disorder would not be made. Substance/medication use. Substance or medication use may explain the lack of interest/arousal. Another medical condition. If the sexual symptoms are considered to be almost exclusively associated with the effects of another medical condition (e. g. , diabetes mellitus, endothelial disease, thyroid dysfunction, central nervous system disease), then a diagnosis of female sexual interest/arousal disorder would not be made. Interpersonal factors. If interpersonal or significant contextual factors, such as severe relationship distress, intimate partner violence, or other significant stressors, explain the sexual interest/arousal symptoms, then a diagnosis of female sexual interest/arousal disorder would not be made. Other sexual dysfunctions. The presence of another sexual dysfunction does not rule out a diagnosis of female sexual interest/arousal disorder. It is common for women to experience more than one sexual dysfunction. For example, the presence of chronic genital pain may lead to a lack of desire for the (painful) sexual activity. Lack of interest and arousal during sexual activity may impair orgasmic ability. For some women, all aspects of the sexual response may be unsatisfying and distressing. Inadequate or absent sexual stimuli. When differential diagnoses are being considered, it is important to assess the adequacy of sexual stimuli within the woman's sexual experience. In cases where inadequate or absent sexual stimuli are contributing to the clinical picture, there may be evidence for clinical care, but a sexual dysfunction diagnosis would not be made. Similarly, transient and adaptive alterations in sexual functioning that are secondary to a significant life or personal event must be considered in the differential diagnosis. Comorbidity: Comorbidity between sexual interest/arousal problems and other sexual difficulties is extremely common. Sexual distress and dissatisfaction with sex life are also highly correlated in women with low sexual desire. Distressing low desire is associated with depression, thyroid problems, anxiety, urinary incontinence, and other medical factors. Arthritis and inflammatory or irritable bowel disease are also associated with sexual arousal prob- lems. Low desire appears to be comorbid with depression, sexual and physical abuse in adulthood, global mental functioning, and use of alcohol\nRelationship To Other Classifications:.", "Disorder: Genito-Pelvic Pain/Penetration Disorder\nICD-9: 302. 76, ICD-10: F52. 6\nNotes: \nDiagnostic Criteria:\n  A: Persistent or recurrent difficulties with one (or more) of the following:\n    - {'dccd_id': '382', 'dcc_id': '459', 'parent_dccd_id': '0', 'dccd_key': '1', 'dccd_value': 'Vaginal penetration during intercourse'}\n    - {'dccd_id': '383', 'dcc_id': '459', 'parent_dccd_id': '0', 'dccd_key': '2', 'dccd_value': 'Marked vulvovaginal or pelvic pain during vaginal intercourse or penetration attempts'}\n    - {'dccd_id': '384', 'dcc_id': '459', 'parent_dccd_id': '0', 'dccd_key': '3', 'dccd_value': 'Marked fear or anxiety about vulvovaginal or pelvic pain in anticipation of, during, or as a result of vaginal penetration.

Disorder Id: 124\nDiagnostic Features: Genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder refers to four commonly comorbid symptom dimensions: 1) difficulty having intercourse, 2) genito-pelvic pain, 3) fear of pain or vaginal penetration, and 4) tension of the pelvic floor muscles (Criterion A). Because major difficulty in any one of these symptom dimensions is often sufficient to cause clinically significant distress, a diagnosis can be made on the basis of marked difficulty in only one symptom dimension. However, all four symptom dimensions should be assessed even if a diagnosis can be made on the basis of only one symptom dimension. Marked dijficulty having vaginal intercourse/penetration (Criterion Al) can vary from a total inability to experience vaginal penetration in any situation (e. g. , intercourse, gynecological examinations, tampon insertion) to the ability to easily experience penetration in one situation and but not in another. Although the most common clinical situation is when a woman is unable to experience intercourse or penetration with a partner, difficulties in undergoing required gynecological examinations may also be present. Marked vulvovaginal or pelvic pain during vaginal intercourse or penetration attempts (Criterion A2) refers to pain occurring in different locations in the genito-pelvic area. Location of pain as well as intensity should be assessed. Typically, pain can be characterized as superficial (vulvovaginal or occurring during penetration) or deep (pelvic; i. e. , not felt until deeper penetration). The intensity of the pain is often not linearly related to distress or interference with sexual intercourse or other sexual activities. Some genito-pelvic pain only occurs when provoked (i. e. , by intercourse or mechanical stim- Illation); other genito-pelvic pain may be spontaneous as well as provoked. Genito-pelvic pain can also be usefully characterized qualitatively (e. g. , \"burning,\" \"cutting,\" \"shooting,\" \"throbbing\"). The pain may persist for a period after intercourse is completed and may also occur during urination. Typically, the pain experienced during sexual intercourse can be reproduced during a gynecological examination. Marked fear or anxiety about vulvovaginal or pelvic pain either in anticipation of, or during, or as a result of vaginal penetration (Criterion A3) is commonly reported by women who have regularly experienced pain during sexual intercourse. This \"normal\" reaction may lead to avoidance of sexual/intimate situations. In other cases, this marked fear does not appear to be closely related to the experience of pain but nonetheless leads to avoidance of intercourse and vaginal penetration situations. Some have described this as similar to a phobic reaction except that the phobic object may be vaginal penetration or the fear of pain. Marked tensing or tightening of the pelvic floor muscles during attempted vaginal penetration (Criterion A4) can vary from reflexive-like spasm of the pelvic floor in response to attempted vaginal entry to \"normal/voluntary\" muscle guarding in response to the anticipated or the repeated experience of pain or to fear or anxiety. In the case of \"normal/ guarding\" reactions, penetration may be possible under circumstances of relaxation. The characterization and assessment of pelvic floor dysfunction is often best undertaken by a specialist gynecologist or by a pelvic floor physical therapist. Recording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis: Genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder is frequently associated with other sexual dysfunctions, particularly reduced sexual desire and interest (female sexual interest/arousal disorder). \u00e4)metimes desire and interest are preserved in sexual situations that are not painful or do not require penetration. Even when individuals with genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder report sexual interest/motivation, there is often behavioral avoidance of sexual situations and opportunities. Avoidance of gynecological examinations despite medical recommendations is also frequent. The pattern of avoidance is similar to that seen in phobic disorders. It is common for women who have not succeeded in having sexual intercourse to come for treatment only when they wish to conceive. Many women with genito-pelvic pain/ penetration disorder will experience associated relationship/marital problems; they also often report that the sjnnptoms significantly diminish their feelings of femininity. In addition to the subtype \"lifelong/acquired,\" five factors should be considered during assessment and diagnosis of genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder because they may be relevant to etiology and/or treatment: 1) partner factors (e. g. , partner's sexual problems, partner's health status); 2) relationship factors (e. g. , poor communication, discrepancies in desire for sexual activity); 3) individual vulnerability factors (e. g. , poor body image, history of sexual or emotional abuse), psychiatric comorbidity (e. g. , depression, anxiety), or stressors (e. g. , job loss, bereavement); 4) cultural/religious factors (e. g. , inhibitions related to prohibitions against sexual activity; attitudes toward sexuality); and 5) medical factors relevant to prognosis, course, or treatment. Each of these factors may contribute differently to the presenting symptoms of different women with this disorder. There are no valid physiological measures of any of the component symptom dimensions of genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder. Validated psychometric inventories may be used to formally assess the pain and anxiety components related to genito-pelvic pain/ penetration disorder. Prevalence: The prevalence of genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder is unknown. However, approximately 15% of women in North America report recurrent pain during intercourse. Difficulties having intercourse appear to be a frequent referral to sexual dysfunction clinics and to specialist clinicians. Development And Course: The development and course of genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder is unclear. Because women generally do not seek treatment until they experience problems in sexual functioning, it can, in general, be difficult to characterize genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder as lifelong (primary) or acquired (secondary). Although women typically come to clinical attention after the initiation of sexual activity, there are often earlier clinical signs. For example, difficulty with or the avoidance of use of tampons is an important predictor of later problems. Difficulties with vaginal penetration (inability or fear or pain) may not be obvious until sexual intercourse is attempted. Even once intercourse is attempted, the frequency of attempts may not be significant or regular. In cases where it is difficult to establish whether symptomatology is lifelong or acquired, it is useful to determine the presence of any consistent period of successful pain-, fear-, and tension-free intercourse. If the experience of such a period can be established, then genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder can be characterized as acquired. Once symptomatology is well established for a period of approximately 6 months, the probability of spontaneous and significant symptomatic remission appears to diminish. Complaints related to genito-pelvic pain peak during early adulthood and in the periand postmenopausal period. Women with complaints about difficulty having intercourse appear to be primarily premenopausal. There may also be an increase in genito-pelvic pain-related symptoms in the postpartum period. Risk And Prognostic Factors: Environmental. Sexual and/or physical abuse have often been cited as predictors of the DSM-IV-defined sexual pain disorders dyspareunia and vaginismus. This is a matter of controversy in the current literature. Genetic and physiological. Women experiencing superficial pain during sexual intercourse often report the onset of the pain after a history of vaginal infections. Even after the infections have resolved and there are no known residual physical findings, the pain persists. Pain during tampon insertion or the inability to insert tampons before any sexual contact has been attempted is an important risk factor for genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder. Culture Related Diagnostic Issues: In the past, inadequate sexual education and religious orthodoxy have often been considered to be culturally related predisposing factors to the DSM-IV diagnosis of vaginismus. This perception appears to be confirmed by recent reports from Turkey, a primarily Muslim country, indicating a strikingly high prevalence for the disorder. However, most available research, although limited in scope, does not support this notion (Lahaie et al. 2010). Gender Related Diagnostic Issues: By definition, the diagnosis of genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder is only given to women. There is relatively new research concerning urological chronic pelvic pain syndrome in men, suggesting that men may experience some similar problems. The research and clinical experience are not sufficiently developed yet to justify the application of this diagnosis to men. Other specified sexual dysfunction or unspecified sexual dysfunction may be diagnosed in men appearing to fit this pattern. Suicide Risk:  \nFunctional Consequences: Functional difficulties in genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder are often associated with interference in relationship satisfaction and sometimes with the ability to conceive via penile/vaginal intercourse\nDiagnostic Markers:  \nDifferential Diagnosis: Another medical condition. In many instances, women with genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder will also be diagnosed with another medical condition (e. g. , lichen sclerosus, endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, vulvovaginal atrophy). In some cases, treating the medical condition may alleviate the genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder. Much of the time, this is not the case. There are no reliable tools or diagnostic methods to allow clinicians to know whether the medical condition or genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder is primary. Often, the associated medical conditions are difficult to diagnose and treat. For example, the increased incidence of postmenopausal pain during intercourse may sometimes be attributable to vaginal dryness or vulvovaginal atrophy associated with declining estrogen levels. The relationship, however, between vulvovaginal atrophy/dryness, estrogen, and pain is not well understood. Somatic symptom and related disorders. Some women with genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder may also be diagnosable with somatic symptom disorder. Since both genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder and the somatic symptom and related disorders are new diagnoses, it is not yet clear whether they can be reliably differentiated. Some women diagnosed with genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder will also be diagnosed with a specific phobia. Inadequate sexual stimuli. It is important that the clinician, in considering differential diagnoses, assess the adequacy of sexual stimuli within the woman's sexual experience. Sexual situations in which there is inadequate foreplay or arousal may lead to difficiilties in penetration, pain, or avoidance. Erectile dysfunction or premature ejaculation in the male partner may result in difficulties with penetration. These conditions should be carefully assessed. In some situations, a diagnosis of genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder may not be appropriate. Comorbidity: Comorbidity between genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder and other sexual difficulties appears to be common. Comorbidity with relationship distress is also common. This is not surprising, since in Western cultures the inability to have (pain-free) intercourse with a desired partner and the avoidance of sexual opportunities may be either a contributing factor to or the result of other sexual or relationship problems. Because pelvic floor symptoms are implicated in the diagnosis of genito-pelvic pain/penetration disorder, there is likely to be a higher prevalence of other disorders related to the pelvic floor or reproductive organs (e. g. , interstitial cystitis, constipation, vaginal infection, endometriosis, irritable bowel syndrome). Relationship To Other Classifications:.", "Disorder: Male Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder\nICD-9: 302. 71, ICD-10: F52. 0\nNotes: \nDiagnostic Criteria:\n  A: Persistently or recurrently deficient (or absent) sexual/erotic thoughts or fantasies and desire for sexual activity. The judgment of deficiency is made by the clinician, taking into account factors that affect sexual functioning, such as age and general and sociocultural contexts of the individual\u2019s life\n  B: The symptoms in Criterion A have persisted for a minimum duration of approximately 6 months. C: The symptoms in Criterion A cause clinically significant distress in the individual. D: The sexual dysfunction is not better explained by a nonsexual mental disorder or as a consequence of severe relationship distress or other significant stressors and is not attributable to thes effects of a substance/medication or another medical condition\nDisorder Id: 125\nDiagnostic Features: When an assessment for male hypoactive sexual desire disorder is being made, interpersonal context must be taken into account. A \"desire discrepancy,\" in which a man has lower desire for sexual activity than his partner, is not sufficient to diagnose male hypoactive sexual desire disorder. Both low/absent desire for sex and deficient/absent sexual thoughts or fantasies are required for a diagnosis of the disorder. There may be variation across men in how sexual desire is expressed. The lack of desire for sex and deficient/absent erotic thoughts or fantasies must be persistent or recurrent and must occur for a minimum duration of approximately 6 months. The inclusion of this duration criterion is meant to safeguard against making a diagnosis in cases in which a man's low sexual desire may represent an adaptive response to adverse life conditions (e. g. , concern about a partner's pregnancy when the man is considering terminating the relationship). The introduction of \"approximately\" in Criterion B allows for clinician judgment in cases in which symptom duration does not meet the recommended 6-month threshold. Recording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis: Male hypoactive sexual desire disorder is sometimes associated with erectile and/or ejaculatory concerns. For example, persistent difficulties obtaining an erection may lead a man to lose interest in sexual activity. Men with hypoactive sexual desire disorder often report that they no longer initiate sexual activity and that they are minimally receptive to a partner's attempt to initiate. Sexual activities (e. g. , masturbation or partnered sexual activity) may sometimes occur even in the presence of low sexual desire. Relationship-specific preferences regarding patterns of sexual initiation must be taken into account when making a diagnosis of male hypoactive sexual desire disorder. Although men are more likely to initiate sexual activity, and thus low desire may be characterized by a pattern of non-initiation, many men may prefer to have their partner initiate sexual activity. In such situations, the man's lack of receptivity to a partner's initiation should be considered when evaluating low desire. In addition to the subtypes \"lifelong/acquired\" and \"generalized/situational,\" the following five factors must be considered during assessment and diagnosis of male hypoactive sexual desire disorder given that they may be relevant to etiology and/or treatment: 1) partner factors (e. g. , partner's sexual problems, partner's health status); 2) relationship factors (e. g. , poor communication, discrepancies in desire for sexual activity); 3) individual vulnerability factors (e. g. , poor body image, history of sexual or emotional abuse), psychiatric comorbidity (e. g. , depression, anxiety), or stressors (e. g. , job loss, bereavement); 4) cultural/religious factors (e. g. , inhibitions related to prohibitions against sexual activity; attitudes toward sexuality); and 5) medical factors relevant to prognosis, course, or treat- ment. Each of these factors may contribute differently to the presenting symptoms of different men with this disorder. Prevalence: The prevalence of male hypoactive sexual desire disorder varies depending on country of origin and method of assessment. Approximately 6% of younger men (ages 18-24 years) and 41% of older men (ages 66-74 years) have problems with sexual desire. However, a persistent lack of interest in sex, lasting 6 months or more, affects only a small proportion of men ages 16-44 (1. 8%). Development And Course: By definition, lifelong male hypoactive sexual desire disorder indicates that low or no sexual desire has always been present, whereas the acquired subtype would be assigned if the man's low desire developed after a period of normal sexual desire. There is a requirement that low desire persist for approximately 6 months or more; thus, short-term changes in sexual desire should not be diagnosed as male hypoactive sexual desire disorder. There is a normative age-related decline in sexual desire. Like women, men identify a variety of triggers for their sexual desire, and they describe a wide range of reasons that they choose to engage in sexual activity. Although erotic visual cues may be more potent elicitors of desire in younger men, the potency of sexual cues may decrease with age and must be considered when evaluating men for hypoactive sexual desire disorder. Risk And Prognostic Factors: Temperamental. Mood and anxiety symptoms appear to be strong predictors of low desire in men. Up to half of men with a past history of psychiatric symptoms may have moderate or severe loss of desire, compared with only 15% of those without such a history. A man's feelings about himself, his perception of his partner's sexual desire toward him, feelings of being emotionally connected, and contextual variables may all negatively (as well as positively) affect sexual desire. Environmental. Alcohol use may increase the occurrence of low desire. Among gay men, self-directed homophobia, interpersonal problems, attitudes, lack of adequate sex education, and trauma resulting from early life experiences must be taken into account in explaining the low desire. Social and cultural contextual factors should also be considered. Genetic and physiological. Endocrine disorders such as hyperprolactinemia significantly affect sexual desire in men. Age is a significant risk factor for low desire in men. It is unclear whether or not men with low desire also have abnormally low levels of testosterone; however, among hypogonadal men, low desire is conmion. There also may be a critical threshold below which testosterone will affect sexual desire in men and above which there is little effect of testosterone on men's desire\nCulture Related Diagnostic Issues: There is marked variability in prevalence rates of low desire across cultures, ranging from 12. 5% in Northern European men to 28% in Southeast Asian men ages 40-80 years. Just as there are higher rates of low desire among East Asian subgroups of women, men of East Asian ancestry also have higher rates of low desire. Guilt about sex may mediate this association between East Asian ethnicity and sexual desire in men. Gender Related Diagnostic Issues: In contrast to the classification of sexual disorders in women, desire and arousal disorders have been retained as separate constructs in men. Despite some similarities in the experi\u00ad ence of desire across men and women, and the fact that desire fluctuates over time and is dependent on contextual factors, men do report a significantly higher intensity and frequency of sexual desire compared with women\nSuicide Risk:  \nFunctional Consequences:  \nDiagnostic Markers:  \nDifferential Diagnosis: Nonsexual mental disorders. Nonsexual mental disorders, such as major depressive disorder, which is characterized by \"markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities,\" may explain the lack of sexual desire. If the lack of desire is better explained by another mental disorder, then a diagnosis of male hypoactive sexual desire disorder would not be made. Substance/medication use. Substance/medication use may explain the lack of sexual desire. Another medical condition. If the low/absent desire and deficient/absent erotic thoughts or fantasies are better explained by the effects of another medical condition (e. g. , hypogonadism, diabetes mellitus, thyroid dysfunction, central nervous system disease), then a diagnosis of male hypoactive sexual desire disorder would not be made. lnte\u03c6ersonal factors. If interpersonal or significant contextual factors, such as severe relationship distress or other significant stressors, are associated with the loss of desire in the man, then a diagnosis of male hypoactive sexual desire disorder would not be made. Other sexual dysfunctions. The presence of another sexual dysfunction does not rule out a diagnosis of male hypoactive sexual desire disorder; there is some evidence that up to one-half of men with low sexual desire also have erectile difficulties, and slightly fewer may also have early ejaculation difficulties. If the man's low desire is explained by self-identification as an asexual, then a diagnosis of male hypoactive sexual desire disorder is not made. Comorbidity: Depression and other mental disorders, as well as endocrinological factors, are often comorbid with male hypoactive sexual desire disorder. Relationship To Other Classifications:.", "Disorder: Premature (Early) Ejaculation\nICD-9: 302. 75, ICD-10: F52. 4\nNotes: \nDiagnostic Criteria:\n  A: A persistent or recurrent pattern of ejaculation occurring during partnered sexual activity within approximately 1 minute following vaginal penetration and before the individual wishes it. Note: Although the diagnosis of premature (early) ejaculation may be applied to individuals engaged in nonvaginal sexual activities, specific duration criteria have not been established for these activities\n  B: The symptom in Criterion A must have been present for at least 6 months and must be experienced on almost all or all (approximately 75%-100%) occasions of sexual activity (in identified situational contexts or, if generalized, in all contexts). C: The symptom in Criterion A causes clinically significant distress in the individual\n  D: The sexual dysfunction is not better explained by a nonsexual mental disorder or as a consequence of severe relationship distress or other significant stressors and is not attributable to the effects of a substance/medication or another medical condition. Disorder Id: 126\nDiagnostic Features: Premature (early) ejaculation is manifested by ejaculation that occurs prior to or shortly after vaginal penetration, operationalized by an individual's estimate of ejaculatory latency (i. e. , elapsed time before ejaculation) after vaginal penetration. Estimated and measured intravaginal ejaculatory latencies are highly correlated as long as the ejaculatory latency is of short duration; therefore, self-reported estimates of ejaculatory latency are sufficient for diagnostic pu\u03c6oses. A 60-second intravaginal ejaculatory latency time is an appropriate cutoff for the diagnosis of lifelong premature (early) ejaculation in heterosexual men. There are insufficient data to determine if this duration criterion can be applied to acquired premature (early) ejaculation. The durational definition may apply to males of varying sexual orientations, since ejaculatory latencies appear to be similar across men of different sexual orientations and across different sexual activities. Recording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis: Many males with premature (early) ejaculation complain of a sense of lack of control over ejaculation and report apprehension about their anticipated inability to delay ejaculation on future sexual encounters. The following factors may be relevant in the evaluation of any sexual dysfunction: 1) partner factors (e. g. , partner's sexual problems, partner's health status); 2) relationship factors (e. g. , poor conrmiunication, discrepancies in desire for sexual activity); 3) individual vulnerability factors (e. g. , poor body image, history of sexual or emotional abuse), psychiatric comorbidity (e. g. , depression, anxiety), and stressors (e. g. , job loss, bereavement); 4) cultural/ religious factors (e. g. , inhibitions related to prohibitions against sexual activity; attitudes toward sexuality); and 5) medical factors relevant to prognosis, course, or treatment. Prevalence: Estimates of the prevalence of premature (early) ejaculation vary widely depending on the definition utilized. Internationally, more than 20%-30% of men ages 18-70 years report concern about how rapidly they ejaculate. With the new definition of premature (early) ejaculation (i. e. , ejaculation occurring within approximately 1 minute of vaginal penetration), only l%-3% of men would be diagnosed with the disorder. Prevalence of premature (early) ejaculation may increase with age. Development And Course: By definition, lifelong premature (early) ejaculation starts during a male's initial sexual experiences and persists thereafter. Some men may experience premature (early) ejaculation during their initial sexual encounters but gain ejaculatory control over time. It is the persistence of ejaculatory problems for longer than 6 months that determines the diagnosis of premature (early) ejaculation. In contrast, some men develop the disorder after a period of having a normal ejaculatory latency, known as acquired premature (early) ejaculation. There is far less known about acquired premature (early) ejaculation than about lifelong premahire (early) ejaculation. The acquired form likely has a later onset, usually appearing during or after the fourth decade of life. Lifelong is relatively stable throughout life. Little is known about the course of acquired premature (early) ejaculation. Reversal of medical conditions such as hyperthyroidism and prostatitis appears to restore ejaculatory latencies to baseline values. Lifelong premature (early) ejaculation begins with early sexual experiences and persists throughout an individual's life. In approximately 20% of men with premature (early) ejaculation, ejaculatory latencies decrease further with age. Age and relationship length have been found to be negatively associated with prevalence of premature (early) ejaculation\nRisk And Prognostic Factors: Temperamental. Premature (early) ejaculation may be more common in men with anxiety disorders, especially social anxiety disorder (social phobia). Genetic and physiological. There is a moderate genetic contribution to lifelong premature (early) ejaculation. Premature (early) ejaculation may be associated with dopamine transporter gene polymorphism or serotonin transporter gene polymorphism. Thyroid disease, prostatitis, and drug withdrawal are associated with acquired premature (early) ejaculation. Positron emission tomography measures of regional cerebral blood flow during ejaculation have shown primary activation in the mesocephalic transition zone, including the ventral tegmental area\nCulture Related Diagnostic Issues: Perception of what constitutes a normal ejaculatory latency is different in many cultures. Measured ejaculatory latencies may differ in some countries. Such differences may be explained by cultural or religious factors as well as genetic differences between populations\nGender Related Diagnostic Issues: Premature (early) ejaculation is a sexual disorder in males. Males and their sexual partners may differ in their perception of what constitutes an acceptable ejaculatory latency. There may be increasing concerns in females about early ejaculation in their sexual partners, which may be a reflection of changing societal attitudes concerning female sexual activity. Suicide Risk:  \nFunctional Consequences: A pattern of premature (early) ejaculation may be associated with decreased self-esteem, a sense of lack of control, and adverse consequences for partner relationships. It may also cause personal distress in the sexual partner and decreased sexual satisfaction in the sexual partner. Ejaculation prior to penetration may be associated with difficulties in conception. Diagnostic Markers: Ejaculatory latency is usually monitored in research settings by the sexual partner utilizing a timing device (e. g. , stopwatch), though this is not ideal in real-life sexual situations. For vaginal intercourse, the time between intravaginal penetration and ejaculation is measured\nDifferential Diagnosis: Substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction. When problems with premature ejaculation are due exclusively to substance use, intoxication, or withdrawal, substance/ medication-induced sexual dysfunction should be diagnosed. Ejaculatory concerns that do not meet diagnostic criteria. It is necessary to identify males with normal ejaculatory latencies who desire longer ejaculatory latencies and males who have episodic premature (early) ejaculation (e. g. , during the first sexual encounter with a new partner when a short ejaculatory latency may be common or normative). Neither of these situations would lead to a diagnosis of premature (early) ejaculation, even though these situations may be distressing to some males\nComorbidity: Premature (early) ejaculation may be associated with erectile problems. In many cases, it may be difficult to determine which difficulty preceded the other. Lifelong premature (early) ejaculation may be associated with certain anxiety disorders. Acquired premature (early) ejaculation may be associated with prostatitis, thyroid disease, or drug withdrawal (e. g. , during opioid withdrawal). Relationship To Other Classifications:.", "Disorder: Substance/Medication-Induced Sexual Dysfunction\nICD-9: Variable, ICD-10: Variable\nNotes: \nDiagnostic Criteria:\n  A: A clinically significant disturbance in sexual function is predominant in the clinical picture. B: There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings of both (1)and (2):\n  C: The disturbance is not better explained by a sexual dysfunction that is not substance/ medication-induced. Such evidence of an independent sexual dysfunction could include the following: The symptoms precede the onset of the substance/medication use; the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time (e. g. , about 1 month) after the cessation of acute withdrawal or severe intoxication; or there is other evidence suggesting the existence of an independent non-substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction (e. g. , a history of recurrent non-substance/medication-related episodes). D: The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium\n  E: The disturbance causes clinically significant distress in the individual. Disorder Id: 127\nDiagnostic Features: The major feature is a disturbance in sexual function that has a temporal relationship with substance/medication initiation, dose increase, or substance/medication discontinuation. Recording Procedures: ICD-9-CM. The name of the substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction begins with the specific substance (e. g. , alcohol, fluoxetine) that is presumed to be causing the sexual dysfunction. The diagnostic code is selected from the table included in the criteria set, which is based on the drug class. For substances that do not fit into any of the classes (e. g. , fluoxetine), the code for \"other substance\" should be used; and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of substance is unknown, the category \"unknown substance\" should be used. The name of the disorder is followed by the specification of onset (i. e. , onset during intoxication, onset during withdrawal, with onset after medication use), followed by the severity specifier (e. g. , mild, moderate, severe). Unlike the recording procedures for ICD-10- CM, which combine the substance-induced disorder and substance use disorder into a single code, for ICD-9-CM a separate diagnostic code is given for the substance use disorder. For example, in the case of erectile dysfunction occurring during intoxication in a man with a severe alcohol use disorder, the diagnosis is 291. 89 alcohol-induced sexual dysfunction, with onset during intoxication, moderate. An additional diagnosis of 303. 90 severe alcohol use disorder is also given. When more than one substance is judged to play a sig- nificant role in the development of the sexual dysfunction, each should be listed separately (e. g. , 292. 89 cocaine-induced sexual dysfunction with onset during intoxication, moderate; 292. 89 fluoxetine-induced sexual dysfunction, with onset after medication use). ICD-10-CM. The name of the substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction begins with the specific substance (e. g. , alcohol, fluoxetine) that is presumed to be causing the sexual dysfunction. The diagnostic code is selected from the table included in the criteria set, which is based on the drug class and presence or absence of a comorbid substance use disorder. For substances that do not fit into any of the classes (e. g. , fluoxetine), the code for \"other substance\" should be used; and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of substance is unknown, the category \"unknown substance\" should be used. When recording the name of the disorder, the comorbid substance use disorder (if any) is listed first, followed by the word \"with,\" followed by the name of the substance-induced sexual dysfunction, followed by the specification of onset (i. e. , onset during intoxication, onset during withdrawal, with onset after medication use), followed by the severity specifier (e. g. , mild, moderate, severe). For example, in the case of erectile dysfunction occurring during intoxication in a man with a severe alcohol use disorder, the diagnosis is F10. 281 moderate alcohol use disorder with alcohol-induced sexual dysfunction, with onset during intoxication, moderate. A separate diagnosis of the comorbid severe alcohol use disorder is not given. If the substance-induced sexual dysfunction occurs without a comorbid substance use disorder (e. g. , after a one-time heavy use of the substance), no accompanying substance use disorder is noted (e. g. , F15. 981 amphetamine-induced sexual dysfunction, with onset during intoxication). When more than one substance is judged to play a significant role in the development of the sexual dysfunction, each should be listed separately (e. g. , F14. 181 mild cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced sexual dysfunction, with onset during intoxication, moderate; F19. 981 fluoxetine-induced sexual dysfunction, with onset after medication use, moderate). Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis: Sexual dysfunctions can occur in association with intoxication with the following classes of substances: alcohol; opioids; sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics; stimulants (including cocaine); and other (or unknown) substances. Sexual dysfunctions can occur in association with withdrawal from the following classes of substances: alcohol; opioids; sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics; and other (or unknown) substances. Medications that can induce sexual dysfunctions include antidepressants, antipsychotics, and hormonal contraceptives. The most commonly reported side effect of antidepressant drugs is difficulty with orgasm or ejaculation. Problems with desire and erection are less frequent. Approximately 30% of sexual complaints are clinically significant. Certain agents, such as bupropion and mirtazapine, appear not to be associated with sexual side effects. The sexual problems associated with antipsychotic drugs, including problems with sexual desire, erection, lubrication, ejaculation, or orgasm, have occurred with typical as well as atypical agents. However, problems are less common with prolactin-sparing antipsychotics than with agents that cause significant prolactin elevation. Although the effects of mood stabilizers on sexual function are unclear, it is possible that lithium and anticonvulsants, with the possible exception of lamotrigine, have adverse effects on sexual desire. Problems with orgasm may occur with gabapentin. Similarly, there may be a higher prevalence of erectile and orgasmic problems associated with benzodiazepines. There have not been such reports with buspirone. Many nonpsychiatric medications, such as cardiovascular, cytotoxic, gastrointestinal, and hormonal agents, are associated with disturbances in sexual function. Illicit substance use is associated with decreased sexual desire, erectile dysfunction, and difficulty reaching orgasm. Sexual dysfunctions are also seen in individuals receiving methadone but are seldom reported by patients receiving bupreno\u03c6hine. Chronic alcohol abuse and chronic nicotine abuse are associated with erectile problems. Prevalence: The prevalence and the incidence of substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction are unclear, likely because of underreporting of treatment-emergent sexual side effects. Data on substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction typically concern the effects of antidepressant drugs. The prevalence of antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction varies in part depending on the specific agent. Approximately 25%-80% of individuals taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, serotonergic antidepressants, and combined serotonergic-adrenergic antidepressants report sexual side effects. There are differences in the incidence of sexual side effects between some serotonergic and combined adrenergic-serotonergic antidepressants, although it is unclear if these differences are clinically significant. Approximately 50% of individuals taking antipsychotic medications will experience adverse sexual side effects, including problems with sexual desire, erection, lubrication, ejaculation, or orgasm. The incidence of these side effects among different antipsychotic agents is unclear. Exact prevalence and incidence of sexual dysfunctions among users of nonpsychiatric medications such as cardiovascular, cytotoxic, gastrointestinal, and hormonal agents are unknown. Elevated rates of sexual dysfunction have been reported with methadone or high-dose opioid drugs for pain. There are increased rates of decreased sexual desire, erectile dysfunction, and difficulty reaching orgasm associated with illicit substance use. The prevalence of sexual problems appears related to chronic drug abuse and appears higher in individuals who abuse heroin (approximately 60%-70%) than in individuals who abuse amphetamines or 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (i. e. , MDMA, ecstasy). Elevated rates of sexual dysfunction are also seen in individuals receiving methadone but are seldom reported by patients receiving buprenorphine. Chronic alcohol abuse and chronic nicotine abuse are related to higher rates of erectile problems\nDevelopment And Course: The onset of antidepressant-induced sexual dysfunction may be as early as 8 days after the agent is first taken. Approximately 30% of individuals with mild to moderate orgasm delay will experience spontaneous remission of the dysfunction within 6 months. In some cases, serotonin reuptake inhibitor-induced sexual dysfunction may persist after the agent is discontinued. The time to onset of sexual dysfunction after initiation of antipsychotic drugs or drugs of abuse is unknown. It is probable that the adverse effects of nicotine and alcohol may not appear until after years of use. Premature (early) ejaculation can sometimes occur after cessation of opioid use. There is some evidence that disturbances in sexual function related to substance/medication use increase with age\nRisk And Prognostic Factors:  \nCulture Related Diagnostic Issues: There may be an interaction among cultural factors, the influence of medications on sexual functioning, and the response of the individual to those changes\nGender Related Diagnostic Issues: Some gender differences in sexual side effects may exist. Suicide Risk:  \nFunctional Consequences: Medication-induced sexual dysfunction may result in medication noncompliance\nDiagnostic Markers:  \nDifferential Diagnosis: Non-substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunctions. Many mental conditions, such as depressive, bipolar, anxiety, and psychotic disorders, are associated with disturbances of sexual function. Thus, differentiating a substance/medication-induced sexual dysfunction from a manifestation of the underlying mental disorder can be quite difficult. The diagnosis is usually established if a close relationship between substance/medication initiation or discontinuation is observed. A clear diagnosis can be established if the problem occurs after substance/medication initiation, dissipates with substance/medication discontinuation, and recurs with introduction of the same agent. Most substance/medication-induced side effects occur shortly after initiation or discontinuation. Sexual side effects that only occur after chronic use of a substance/medication may be extremely difficult to diagnose with certainty\nComorbidity:  \nRelationship To Other Classifications:  \nSeverity and Substance: {'pmo_id': '15', 'property_value': 'Mild use disorder of Alcohol', 'icd_9_override': '291. 89', 'icd_10_override': 'F10. 181'}, {'pmo_id': '21', 'property_value': 'Mild use disorder of Opioid', 'icd_9_override': '292. 89', 'icd_10_override': 'F11. 181'}, {'pmo_id': '22', 'property_value': 'Mild use disorder of Sedative, hypnotic or anxiolytic', 'icd_9_override': '292. 89', 'icd_10_override': 'F13. 181'}, {'pmo_id': '23', 'property_value': 'Mild use disorder of Amphetamine (or other stimulant)', 'icd_9_override': '292. 89', 'icd_10_override': 'F15. 181'}, {'pmo_id': '24', 'property_value': 'Mild use disorder of Cocaine', 'icd_9_override': '292. 89', 'icd_10_override': 'F14. 181'}, {'pmo_id': '25', 'property_value': 'Mild use disorder of Other (or unknown) substance', 'icd_9_override': '292. 89', 'icd_10_override': 'F19. 181'}, {'pmo_id': '26', 'property_value': 'Moderate use disorder of Alcohol', 'icd_9_override': '291. 89', 'icd_10_override': 'F10. 281'}, {'pmo_id': '32', 'property_value': 'Moderate use disorder of Opioid', 'icd_9_override': '292. 89', 'icd_10_override': 'F11. 281'}, {'pmo_id': '33', 'property_value': 'Moderate use disorder of Sedative, hypnotic or anxiolytic', 'icd_9_override': '292. 89', 'icd_10_override': 'F13. 281'}, {'pmo_id': '34', 'property_value': 'Moderate use disorder of Amphetamine (or other stimulant)', 'icd_9_override': '292. 89', 'icd_10_override': 'F15. 281'}, {'pmo_id': '35', 'property_value': 'Moderate use disorder of Cocaine', 'icd_9_override': '292. 89', 'icd_10_override': 'F14. 281'}, {'pmo_id': '36', 'property_value': 'Moderate use disorder of Other (or unknown) substance', 'icd_9_override': '292. 89', 'icd_10_override': 'F19. 281'}, {'pmo_id': '37', 'property_value': 'Severe use disorder of Alcohol', 'icd_9_override': '291. 89', 'icd_10_override': 'F10. 281'}, {'pmo_id': '43', 'property_value': 'Severe use disorder of Opioid', 'icd_9_override': '292. 89', 'icd_10_override': 'F11. 281'}, {'pmo_id': '44', 'property_value': 'Severe use disorder of Sedative, hypnotic or anxiolytic', 'icd_9_override': '292. 89', 'icd_10_override': 'F13. 281'}, {'pmo_id': '45', 'property_value': 'Severe use disorder of Amphetamine (or other stimulant)', 'icd_9_override': '292. 89', 'icd_10_override': 'F15. 281'}, {'pmo_id': '46', 'property_value': 'Severe use disorder of Cocaine', 'icd_9_override': '292. 89', 'icd_10_override': 'F14. 281'}, {'pmo_id': '47', 'property_value': 'Severe use disorder of Other (or unknown) substance', 'icd_9_override': '292. 89', 'icd_10_override': 'F19. 281'}, {'pmo_id': '48', 'property_value': 'Alcohol, without use disorder', 'icd_9_override': '291. 89', 'icd_10_override': 'F10. 981'}, {'pmo_id': '54', 'property_value': 'Opioid, without use disorder', 'icd_9_override': '292. 89', 'icd_10_override': 'F11. 981'}, {'pmo_id': '55', 'property_value': 'Sedative, hypnotic or anxiolytic, without use disorder', 'icd_9_override': '292. 89', 'icd_10_override': 'F13. 981'}, {'pmo_id': '56', 'property_value': 'Amphetamine (or other stimulant), without use disorder', 'icd_9_override': '292. 89', 'icd_10_override': 'F15. 981'}, {'pmo_id': '57', 'property_value': 'Cocaine, without use disorder', 'icd_9_override': '292. 89', 'icd_10_override': 'F14. 981'}, {'pmo_id': '58', 'property_value': 'Other (or unknown) substance, without use disorder', 'icd_9_override': '292. 89', 'icd_10_override': 'F19. 981'}.", "Disorder: Other Specified Sexual Dysfunction\nICD-9: 302. 79, ICD-10: F52. 8\nNotes: This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a sexual dysfunction that cause clinically significant distress in the individual predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the sexual dysfunctions diagnostic class.

'}\nDisorder Id: 130\nDiagnostic Features: Individuals with gender dysphoria have a marked incongruence between the gender they have been assigned to (usually at birth, referred to as natal gender) and their experienced/ expressed gender. This discrepancy is the core component of the diagnosis. There must also be evidence of distress about this incongruence. Experienced gender may include alternative gender identities beyond binary stereotypes. Consequently, the distress is not limited to a desire to simply be of the other gender, but may include a desire to be of an alternative gender, provided that it differs from the individual's assigned gender. Gender dysphoria manifests itself differently in different age groups. Prepubertal natal girls with gender dysphoria may express the wish to be a boy, assert they are a boy, or assert they will grow up to be a man. They prefer boys' clothing and hairstyles, are often perceived by strangers as boys, and may ask to be called by a boy's name. Usually, they display intense negative reactions to parental attempts to have them wear dresses or other feminine attire. Some may refuse to attend school or social events where such clothes are required. These girls may demonstrate marked cross-gender identification in role-playing, dreams, and fantasies. Contact sports, rough-and-tumble play, traditional boyhood games, and boys as playmates are most often preferred. They show little interest in stereotypically feminine toys (e. g. , dolls) or activities (e. g. , feminine dress-up or role-play). Occasionally, they refuse to urinate in a sitting position. Some natal girls may express a desire to have a penis or claim to have a penis or that they will grow one when older. They may also state that they do not want to develop breasts or menstruate. Prepubertal natal boys with gender dysphoria may express the wish to be a girl or assert they are a girl or that they will grow up to be a woman. They have a preference for dressing in girls' or women's clothes or may improvise clothing from available materials (e. g. , using towels, aprons, and scarves for long hair or skirts). These children may roleplay female figures (e. g. , playing \"mother\") and often are intensely interested in female fantasy figures. Traditional feminine activities, stereotypical games, and pastimes (e. g. , \"playing house\"; drawing feminine pictures; watching television or videos of favorite female characters) are most often preferred. Stereotypical female-type dolls (e. g. . Barbie) are often favorite toys, and girls are their preferred playmates. They avoid rough-and-tumble play and competitive sports and have little interest in stereotypically masculine toys (e. g. , cars, trucks). Some may pretend not to have a penis and insist on sitting to urinate. More rarely, they may state that they find their penis or testes disgusting, that they wish them removed, or that they have, or wish to have, a vagina. In young adolescents with gender dysphoria, clinical features may resemble those of children or adults with the condition, depending on developmental level. As secondary sex characteristics of young adolescents are not yet fully developed, these individuals may not state dislike of them, but they are concerned about imminent physical changes. In adults with gender dysphoria, the discrepancy between experienced gender and physical sex characteristics is often, but not always, accompanied by a desire to be rid of primary and/or secondary sex characteristics and/or a strong desire to acquire some primary and/or secondary sex characteristics of the other gender. To varying degrees, adults with gender dysphoria may adopt the behavior, clothing, and mannerisms of the experienced gender. They feel uncomfortable being regarded by others, or functioning in society, as members of their assigned gender. Some adults may have a strong desire to be of a different gender and treated as such, and they may have an inner certainty to feel and respond as the experienced gender without seeking medical treatment to alter body characteristics. They may find other ways to resolve the incongruence between experienced/ expressed and assigned gender by partially living in the desired role or by adopting a gender role neither conventionally male nor conventionally female. Recording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis: When visible signs of puberty develop, natal boys may shave their legs at the first signs of hair growth. They sometimes bind their genitals to make erections less visible. Girls may bind their breasts, walk with a stoop, or use loose sweaters to make breasts less visible. Increasingly, adolescents request, or may obtain without medical prescription and supervision, hormonal suppressors (\"blockers\") of gonadal steroids (e. g. , gonadotropin-releasing hormone [GnRH] analog, spironolactone). Clinically referred adolescents often want hormone treatment and many also wish for gender reassignment surgery. Adolescents living in an accepting environment may openly express the desire to be and be treated as the experienced gender and dress partly or completely as the experienced gender, have a hairstyle typical of the experienced gender, preferentially seek friendships with peers of the other gender, and/or adopt a new first name consistent with the experienced gender. Older adolescents, when sexually active, usually do not show or allow partners to touch their sexual organs. For adults with an aversion toward their genitals, sexual activity is constrained by the preference that their genitals not be seen or touched by their partners. Some adults may seek hormone treatment (sometimes without medical prescription and supervision) and gender reassignment surgery. Others are satisfied with either hormone treatment or surgery alone. Adolescents and adults with gender dysphoria before gender reassignment are at increased risk for suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and suicides. After gender reassignment, adjustment may vary, and suicide risk may persist. Prevalence: For natal adult males, prevalence ranges from 0. 005% to 0. 014%, and for natal females, from 0. 002% to 0. 003%. Since not all adults seeking hormone treatment and surgical reassignment attend specialty clinics, these rates are likely modest underestimates. Sex differences in rate of referrals to specialty clinics vary by age group. In children, sex ratios of natal boys to girls range from 2:1 to 4. 5:1. In adolescents, the sex ratio is close to parity; in adults, the sex ratio favors natal males, with ratios ranging from 1:1 to 6. 1:1. In two countries, the sex ratio appears to favor natal females (Japan: 2. 2:1; Poland: 3. 4:1). Development And Course: Because expression of gender dysphoria varies with age, there are separate criteria sets for children versus adolescents and adults. Criteria for children are defined in a more con- crete, behavioral manner than those for adolescents and adults. Many of the core criteria draw on well-dofumented behavioral gender differences between typically developing boys and girls. Young children are less likely than older children, adolescents, and adults to express extreme and persistent anatomic dysphoria. In adolescents and adults, incongruence between experienced gender and somatic sex is a central feature of the diagnosis. Factors related to distress and impairment also vary with age. A very young child may show signs of distress (e. g. , intense crying) only when parents tell the child that he or she is \"really\" not a member of the other gender but only \"desires\" to be. Distress may not be manifest in social environments supportive of the child's desire to live in the role of the other gender and may emerge only if the desire is interfered with. In adolescents and adults, distress may manifest because of strong incongruence between experienced gender and somatic sex. Such distress may, however, be mitigated by supportive environments and knowledge that biomedical treatments exist to reduce incongruence. Impairment (e. g. , school refusal, development of depression, anxiety, and substance abuse) may be a consequence of gender dysphoria. Gender dysphoria without a disorder of sex development. For clinic-referred children, onset of cross-gender behaviors is usually between ages 2 and 4 years. This corresponds to the developmental time period in which most typically developing children begin expressing gendered behaviors and interests. For some preschool-age children, both pervasive cross-gender behaviors and the expressed desire to be the other gender may be present, or, more rarely, labeling oneself as a member of the other gender may occur. In some cases, the expressed desire to be the other gender appears later, usually at entry into elementary school. A small minority of children express discomfort with their sexual anatomy or will state the desire to have a sexual anatomy corresponding to the experienced gender (\"anatomic dysphoria\"). Expressions of anatomic dysphoria become more common as children with gender dysphoria approach and anticipate puberty. Rates of persistence of gender dysphoria from childhood into adolescence or adulthood vary. In natal males, persistence has ranged from 2. 2% to 30%. In natal females, persistence has ranged from 12% to 50%. Persistence of gender dysphoria is modestly correlated with dimensional measures of severity ascertained at the time of a childhood baseline assessment. In one sample of natal males, lower socioeconomic background was also modestly correlated with persistence. It is unclear if particular therapeutic approaches to gender dysphoria in children are related to rates of long-term persistence. Extant follow-up samples consisted of children receiving no formal therapeutic intervention or receiving therapeutic interventions of various types, ranging from active efforts to reduce gender dysphoria to a more neutral, \"watchful waiting\" approach. It is unclear if children \"encouraged\" or supported to live socially in the desired gender will show higher rates of persistence, since such children have not yet been followed longitudinally in a systematic manner. For both natal male and female children showing persistence, almost all are sexually attracted to individuals of their natal sex. For natal male children whose gender dysphoria does not persist, the majority are androphilic (sexually attracted to males) and often self-identify as gay or homosexual (ranging from 63% to 100%). In natal female children whose gender dysphoria does not persist, the percentage who are gynephilic (sexually attracted to females) and self-identify as lesbian is lower (ranging from 32% to 50%). In both adolescent and adult natal males, there are two broad trajectories for development of gender dysphoria: early onset and late onset. Early-onset gender dysphoria starts in childhood and continues into adolescence and adulthood; or, there is an intermittent period in which the gender dysphoria desists and these individuals self-identify as gay or homosexual, followed by recurrence of gender dysphoria. Late-onset gender dysphoria occurs around puberty or much later in life. Some of these individuals report having had a desire to be of the other gender in childhood that was not expressed verbally to others. Others do not recall any signs of childhood gender dysphoria. For adolescent males with late-onset gender dysphoria, parents often report surprise because they did not see signs of gender dysphoria during childhood. Expressions of anatomic dysphoria are more common and salient in adolescents and adults once secondary sex characteristics have developed. Adolescent and adult natal males with early-onset gender dysphoria are almost always sexually attracted to men (androphilic). Adolescents and adults with late-onset gender dysphoria frequently engage in transvestic behavior with sexual excitement. The majority of these individuals are gynephilic or sexually attracted to other posttransition natal males with late-onset gender dysphoria. A substantial percentage of adult males with late-onset gender dysphoria cohabit with or are married to natal females. After gender transition, many self-identify as lesbian. Among adult natal males with gender dysphoria, the early-onset group seeks out clinical care for hormone treatment and reassignment surgery at an earlier age than does the late-onset group. The late-onset group may have more fluctuations in the degree of gender dysphoria and be more ambivalent about and less likely satisfied after gender reassignment surgery. In both adolescent and adult natal females, the most common course is the early-onset form of gender dysphoria. The late-onset form is much less common in natal females compared with natal males. As in natal males with gender dysphoria, there may have been a period in which the gender dysphoria desisted and these individuals self-identified as lesbian; however, with recurrence of gender dysphoria, clinical consultation is sought, often with the desire for hormone treatment and reassignment surgery. Parents of natal adolescent females with the late-onset form also report surprise, as no signs of childhood gender dysphoria were evident. Expressions of anatomic dysphoria are much more common and salient in adolescents and adults than in children. Adolescent and adult natal females with early-onset gender dysphoria are almost always gynephilic. Adolescents and adults with the late-onset form of gender dysphoria are usually androphilic and after gender transition self-identify as gay men. Natal females with the late-onset form do not have co-occurring transvestic behavior with sexual excitement. Gender dysphoria in association with a disorder of sex development. Most individuals with a disorder of sex development who develop gender dysphoria have already come to medical attention at an early age. For many, starting at birth, issues of gender assignment were raised by physicians and parents. Moreover, as infertility is quite common for this group, physicians are more willing to perform cross-sex hormone treatments and genital surgery before adulthood. Disorders of sex development in general are frequently associated with gender-atypical behavior starting in early childhood. However, in the majority of cases, this does not lead to gender dysphoria. As individuals with a disorder of sex development become aware of their medical history and condition, many experience uncertainty about their gender, as opposed to developing a firm conviction that they are another gender. However, most do not progress to gender transition. Gender dysphoria and gender transition may vary considerably as a function of a disorder of sex development, its severity, and assigned gender. Risk And Prognostic Factors: Temperamental. For individuals with gender dysphoria without a disorder of sex development, atypical gender behavior among individuals with early-onset gender dysphoria develops in early preschool age, and it is possible that a high degree of atypicality makes the development of gender dysphoria and its persistence into adolescence and adulthood more likely. Environmental. Among individuals with gender dysphoria without a disorder of sex development, males with gender dysphoria (in both childhood and adolescence) more commonly have older brothers than do males without the condition. Additional predisposing factors under consideration, especially in individuals with late-onset gender dysphoria (adolescence, adulthpod), include habitual fetishistic transvestism developing into autogynephilia (i. e. , sexual arousal associated with the thought or image of oneself as a woman) and other forms of more general social, psychological, or developmental problems. Genetic and physiological. For individuals with gender dysphoria without a disorder of sex development, some genetic contribution is suggested by evidence for (weak) familiality of transsexualism among nontwin siblings, increased concordance for transsexualism in monozygotic compared with dizygotic same-sex twins, and some degree of heritability of gender dysphoria. As to endocrine findings, no endogenous systemic abnormalities in sex-hormone levels have been found in 46,XY individuals, whereas there appear to be increased androgen levels (in the range found in hirsute women but far below normal male levels) in 46,XX individuals. Overall, current evidence is insufficient to label gender dysphoria without a disorder of sex development as a form of intersexuality limited to the central nervous system. In gender dysphoria associated with a disorder of sex development, the likelihood of later gender dysphoria is increased if prenatal production and utilization (via receptor sensitivity) of androgens are grossly atypical relative to what is usually seen in individuals with the same assigned gender. Examples include 46,XY individuals with a history of normal male prenatal hormone milieu but inborn nonhormonal genital defects (as in cloacal bladder exstrophy or penile agenesis) and who have been assigned to the female gender. The likelihood of gender dysphoria is further enhanced by additional, prolonged, highly gender-atypical postnatal androgen exposure with somatic virilization as may occur in female-raised and noncastrated 46,XY individuals with 5-alpha reductase-2 deficiency or 17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-3 deficiency or in female-raised 46,XX individuals with classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia with prolonged periods of non-adherence to glucocorticoid replacement therapy. However, the prenatal androgen milieu is more closely related to gendered behavior than to gender identity. Many individuals with disorders of sex development and markedly gender-atypical behavior do not develop gender dysphoria. Thus, gender-atypical behavior by itself should not be inte\u03c6reted as an indicator of current or future gender dysphoria. There appears to be a higher rate of gender dysphoria and patient-initiated gender change from assigned female to male than from assigned male to female in 46,XY individuals with a disorder of sex development. Culture Related Diagnostic Issues: Individuals with gender dysphoria have been reported across many countries and cultures. The equivalent of gender dysphoria has also been reported in individuals living in cultures with institutionalized gender categories other than male or female. It is unclear whether with these individuals the diagnostic criteria for gender dysphoria would be met. Gender Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nSuicide Risk:  \nFunctional Consequences: Preoccupation with cross-gender wishes may develop at all ages after the first 2-3 years of childhood and often interfere with daily activities. In older children, failure to develop age-typical same-sex peer relationships and skills may lead to isolation from peer groups and to distress. Some children may refuse to attend school because of teasing and harass- ment or pressure to dress in attire associated with their assigned sex. Also in adolescents and adults, preoccupation with cross-gender wishes often interferes with daily activities. Relationship difficulties, including sexual relationship problems, are common, and functioning at school or at work may be impaired. Gender dysphoria, along with atypical gender expression, is associated with high levels of stigmatization, discrimination, and victimization, leading to negative self-concept, increased rates of mental disorder comorbidity, school dropout, and economic marginalization, including unemployment, with attendant social and mental health risks, especially in individuals from resource-poor family backgrounds. In addition, these individuals' access to health services and mental health services may be impeded by structural barriers, such as institutional discomfort or inexperience in working with this patient population\nDiagnostic Markers: Individuals with a somatic disorder of sex development show some correlation of final gender identity outcome with the degree of prenatal androgen production and utilization. However, the correlation is not robust enough for the biological factor, where ascertainable, to replace a detailed and comprehensive diagnostic interview evaluation for gender dysphoria. Differential Diagnosis: Nonconformity to gender roles. Gender dysphoria should be distinguished from simple nonconformity to stereotypical gender role behavior by the strong desire to be of another gender than the assigned one and by the extent and pervasiveness of gender-variant activities and interests. The diagnosis is not meant to merely describe nonconformity to stereotypical gender role behavior (e. g. , \"tomboyism\" in girls, \"girly-boy\" behavior in boys, occasional cross-dressing in adult men). Given the increased openness of atypical gender expressions by individuals across the entire range of the transgender spectrum, it is important that the clinical diagnosis be limited to those individuals whose distress and impairment meet the specified criteria. Transvestic disorder. Transvestic disorder occurs in heterosexual (or bisexual) adolescent and adult males (rarely in females) for whom cross-dressing behavior generates sexual excitement and causes distress and/or impairment without drawing their primary gender into question. It is occasionally accompanied by gender dysphoria. An individual with transvestic disorder who also has clinically significant gender dysphoria can be given both diagnoses. In many cases of late-onset gender dysphoria in gynephilic natal males, transvestic behavior with sexual excitement is a precursor. Body dysmo\u03c6hic disorder. An individual with body dysmorphic disorder focuses on the alteration or removal of a specific body part because it is perceived as abnormally formed, not because it represents a repudiated assigned gender. When an individual's presentation meets criteria for both gender dysphoria and body dysmorphic disorder, both diagnoses can be given. Individuals wishing to have a healthy limb amputated (termed by some body integrity identity disorder) because it makes them feel more \"complete\" usually do not wish to change gender, but rather desire to live as an amputee or a disabled person. Schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. In schizophrenia, there may rarely be delusions of belonging to some other gender. In the absence of psychotic symptoms, insistence by an individual with gender dysphoria that he or she is of some other gender is not considered a delusion. Schizophrenia (or other psychotic disorders) and gender dysphoria may co-occur. Other clinical presentations. Some individuals with an emasculinization desire who develop an alternative, nonmale/nonfemale gender identity do have a presentation that meets criteria for gender dysphoria. However, some males seek castration and/or penectomy for aesthetic reasons or to remove psychological effects of androgens without changing male identity; in these cases, the criteria for gender dysphoria are not met. Comorbidity: Clinically referred children with gender dysphoria show elevated levels of emotional and behavioral problems\u2014most commonly, anxiety, disruptive and impulse-control, and de- pressive disorders. In prepubertal children, increasing age is associated with having more behavioral or emotional problems; this is related to the increasing non-acceptance of gender-variant behavior by others. In older children, gender-variant behavior often leads to peer ostracism, which may lead to more behavioral problems. The prevalence of mental health problems differs among cultures; these differences may also be related to differences in attitudes toward gender variance in children. However, also in some non-Westem cultures, anxiety has been found to be relatively common in individuals with gender dysphoria, even in cultures with accepting attitudes toward gender-variant behavior. Autism spectrum disorder is more prevalent in clinically referred children with gender dysphoria than in the general population. Clinically referred adolescents with gender dysphoria appear to have comorbid mental disorders, with anxiety and depressive disorders being the most common. As in children, autism spectrum disorder is more prevalent in clinically referred adolescents with gender dysphoria than in the general population. Clinically referred adults with gender dysphoria may have coexisting mental health problems, most commonly anxiety and depressive disorders\nRelationship To Other Classifications:.", "Disorder: Other Specified Gender Dysphoria\nICD-9: 302. 6, ICD-10: F64. 8\nNotes: This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of gender dysphoria that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for gender dysphoria.

C: The behaviors do not occur exclusively during the course of a psychotic, substance use, depressive, or bipolar disorder. Also, the criteria are not met for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. Disorder Id: 133\nDiagnostic Features: The essential feature of oppositional defiant disorder is a frequent and persistent pattern of angry/irritable mood, argumentative/defiant behavior, or vindictiveness (Criterion A). It is not unusual for individuals with oppositional defiant disorder to show the behavioral features of the disorder without problems of negative mood. However, individuals with the disorder who show the angry/irritable mood symptoms typically show the behavioral features as well. The symptoms of oppositional defiant disorder may be confined to only one setting, and this is most frequently the home. Individuals who show enough symptoms to meet the diagnostic threshold, even if it is only at home, may be significantly impaired in their social functioning. However, in more severe cases, the symptoms of the disorder are present in multiple settings. Given that the pervasiveness of symptoms is an indicator of the severity of the disorder, it is critical that the individual's behavior be assessed across multiple settings and relationships. Because these behaviors are common among siblings, they must be observed during interactions with persons other than siblings. Also, because symptoms of the disorder are typically more evident in interactions with adults or peers whom the individual knows well, they may not be apparent during a clinical examination. The symptoms of oppositional defiant disorder can occur to some degree in individuals without this disorder. There are several key considerations for determining if the behaviors are symptomatic of oppositional defiant disorder. First, the diagnostic threshold of four or more symptoms within the preceding 6 months must be met. Second, the persistence and frequency of the symptoms should exceed what is normative for an individual's age, gender, and culture. For example, it is not unusual for preschool children to show temper tantrums on a weekly basis. Temper outbursts for a preschool child would be considered a symptom of oppositional defiant disorder only if they occurred on most days for the preceding 6 months, if they occurred with at least three other symptoms of the disorder, and if the temper outbursts contributed to the significant impairment associated with the disorder (e. g. , led to destruction of property during outbursts, resulted in the child being asked to leave a preschool). The symptoms of the disorder often are part of a pattern of problematic interactions with others. Furthermore, individuals with this disorder typically do not regard themselves as angry, oppositional, or defiant. Instead, they often justify their behavior as a response to unreasonable demands or circumstances. Thus, it can be difficult to disentangle the relative contribution of the individual with the disorder to the problematic interactions he or she experiences. For example, children with oppositional defiant disorder may have experienced a history of hostile parenting, and it is often impossible to determine if the child's behavior caused the parents to act in a more hostile manner toward the child, if the parents' hostility led to the child's problematic behavior, or if there was some combination of both. Whether or not the clinician can separate the relative contributions of potential causal factors should not influence whether or not the diagnosis is made. In the event that the child may be living in particularly poor conditions where neglect or mistreatment may occur (e. g. , in institutional settings), clinical attention to reducing the contribution of the environment may be helpful\nRecording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis: In children and adolescents, oppositional defiant disorder is more prevalent in families in which child care is disrupted by a succession of different caregivers or in families in which harsh, inconsistent, or neglectful child-rearing practices are common. Two of the most common co-occurring conditions with oppositional defiant disorder are attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and conduct disorder (see the section \"Comorbidity\" for this disorder). Oppositional defiant disorder has been associated with increased risk for suicide attempts, even after comorbid disorders are controlled for. Prevalence: The prevalence of oppositional defiant disorder ranges from 1% to 11%, with an average prevalence estimate of around 3. 3%. The rate of oppositional defiant disorder may vary depending on the age and gender of the child. The disorder appears to be somewhat more prevalent in males than in females (1. 4:1) prior to adolescence. This male predominance is not consistently found in samples of adolescents or adults. Development And Course: The first symptoms of oppositional defiant disorder usually appear during the preschool years and rarely later than early adolescence. Oppositional defiant disorder often precedes the development of conduct disorder, especially for those with the childhood-onset type of conduct disorder. However, many children and adolescents with oppositional defiant disorder do not subsequently develop conduct disorder. Oppositional defiant disorder also conveys risk for the development of anxiety disorders and major depressive disorder, even in the absence of conduct disorder. The defiant, argumentative, and vindictive symptoms carry most of the risk for conduct disorder, whereas the angry-irritable mood symptoms carry most of the risk for emotional disorders. Manifestations of the disorder across development appear consistent. Children and adolescents with oppositional defiant disorder are at increased risk for a number of problems in adjustment as adults, including antisocial behavior, impulse-control problems, substance abuse, anxiety, and depression. Many of the behaviors associated with oppositional defiant disorder increase in frequency during the preschool period and in adolescence. Thus, it is especially critical during these development periods that the frequency and intensity of these behaviors be evaluated against normative levels before it is decided that they are symptoms of oppositional defiant disorder. Risk And Prognostic Factors: Temperamental. Temperamental factors related to problems in emotional regulation (e. g. , high levels of emotional reactivity, poor frustration tolerance) have been predictive of the disorder. Environmental. Harsh, inconsistent, or neglectful child-rearing practices are common in families of children and adolescents with oppositional defiant disorder, and these parenting practices play an important role in many causal theories of the disorder. Genetic and physiological. A number of neurobiological markers (e. g. , lower heart rate and skin conductance reactivity; reduced basal cortisol reactivity; abnormalities in the prefrontal cortex and amygdala) have been associated with oppositional defiant disorder. However, the vast majority of studies have not separated children with oppositional defiant disorder from those with conduct disorder. Thus, it is unclear whether there are markers specific to oppositional defiant disorder\nCulture Related Diagnostic Issues: The prevalence of the disorder in children and adolescents is relatively consistent across countries that differ in race and ethnicity. Gender Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nSuicide Risk:  \nFunctional Consequences: When oppositional defiant disorder is persistent throughout development, individuals with the disorder experience frequent conflicts with parents, teachers, supervisors, peers, and romantic partners. Such problems often result in significant impairments in the individual's emotional, social, academic, and occupational adjustment\nDiagnostic Markers:  \nDifferential Diagnosis: Conduct disorder. Conduct disorder and oppositional defiant disorder are both related to conduct problems that bring the individual in conflict with adults and other authority figures (e. g. , teachers, work supervisors). The behaviors of oppositional defiant disorder are typically of a less severe nature than those of conduct disorder and do not include aggression toward people or animals, destruction of property, or a pattern of theft or deceit. Furthermore, oppositional defiant disorder includes problems of emotional dysregulation (i. e. , angry and irritable mood) that are not included in the definition of conduct disorder. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. ADHD is often comorbid with oppositional defiant disorder. To make the additional diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder, it is important to determine that the individual's failure to conform to requests of others is not solely in situations that demand sustained effort and attention or demand that the individual sit still. Depressive and bipolar disorders. Depressive and bipolar disorders often involve negative affect and irritability. As a result, a diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder should not be made if the symptoms occur exclusively during the course of a mood disorder. Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. Oppositional defiant disorder shares with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder the symptoms of chronic negative mood and temper outbursts. However, the severity, frequency, and chronicity of temper outbursts are more severe in individuals with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder than in those with oppositional defiant disorder. Thus, only a minority of children and adolescents whose symptoms meet criteria for oppositional defiant disorder would also be diagnosed with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. When the mood disturbance is severe enough to meet criteria for disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, a diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder is not given, even if all criteria for oppositional defiant disorder are met. Intermittent explosive disorder. Intermittent explosive disorder also involves high rates of anger. However, individuals with this disorder show serious aggression toward others that is not part of the definition of oppositional defiant disorder. Intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder). In individuals with intellectual disability, a diagnosis of oppositional defiant disorder is given only if the oppositional behavior is markedly greater than is commonly observed among individuals of comparable mental age and with comparable severity of intellectual disability. Language disorder. Oppositional defiant disorder must also be distinguished from a failure to follow directions that is the result of impaired language comprehension (e. g. , hearing loss). Social anxiety disorder (social phobia). Oppositional defiant disorder must also be distinguished from defiance due to fear of negative evaluation associated with social anxiety disorder\nComorbidity: Rates of oppositional defiant disorder are much higher in samples of children, adolescents, and adults with ADHD, and this may be the result of shared temperamental risk factors. Also, oppositional defiant disorder often precedes conduct disorder, although this appears to be most common in children with the childhood-onset subtype. Individuals with oppositional defiant disorder are also at increased risk for anxiety disorders and major depressive disorder, and this seems largely attributable to the presence of the angryirritable mood symptoms. Adolescents and adults with oppositional defiant disorder also show a higher rate of substance use disorders, although it is unclear if this association is independent of the comorbidity with conduct disorder\nRelationship To Other Classifications:.", "Disorder: Intermittent Explosive Disorder\nICD-9: 312. 34, ICD-10: F63. 81\nNotes: \nDiagnostic Criteria:\n  A: Recurrent behavioral outbursts representing a failure to control aggressive impulses as manifested by either of the following;\n    - {'dccd_id': '415', 'dcc_id': '481', 'parent_dccd_id': '0', 'dccd_key': '1', 'dccd_value': 'Verbal aggression (e. g. , temper tantrums, tirades, verbal arguments or fights) or physical aggression toward property, animals, or other individuals, occurring twice weekly, on average, for a period of 3 months.

'}\n  B: The magnitude of aggressiveness expressed during the recurrent outbursts is grossly out of proportion to the provocation or to any precipitating psychosocial stressors. C: The recurrent aggressive outbursts are not premeditated (i. e. , they are impulsive and/ or anger-based) and are not committed to achieve some tangible objective (e. g. , money, power, intimidation)\n  D: The recurrent aggressive outbursts cause either marked distress in the individual or impairment in occupational or interpersonal functioning, or are associated with financial or legal consequences. E: Chronological age is at least 6 years (or equivalent developmental level)\n  F: The recurrent aggressive outbursts are not better explained by another mental disorder (e. g. , major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, a psychotic disorder, antisocial personality disorder, borderline personality disorder) and are not attributable to another medical condition (e. g. , head trauma, Alzheimer\u2019s disease) or to the physiological effects of a substance (e. g. , a drug of abuse, a medication). For children ages 6-18 years, aggressive behavior that occurs as part of an adjustment disorder should not be considered for this diagnosis\nDisorder Id: 134\nDiagnostic Features: The impulsive (or anger-based) aggressive outbursts in intermittent explosive disorder have a rapid onset and, typically, little or no prodromal period. Outbursts typically last for less than 30 minutes and commonly occur in response to a minor provocation by a close intimate or associate. Individuals with intermittent explosive disorder often have less severe episodes of verbal and/or nondamaging, nondestructive, or noninjurious physical assault (Criterion Al) in between more severe destructive/assaultive episodes (Criterion A2). Criterion A1 defines frequent (i. e. , twice weekly, on average, for a period of 3 months) aggressive outbursts characterized by temper tantrums, tirades, verbal arguments or fights, or assault without damage to objects or without injury to animals or other individuals. Criterion A2 defines infrequent (i. e. , three in a 1-year period) impulsive aggressive outbursts characterized by damaging or destroying an object, regardless of its tangible value, or by assaulting/ striking or otherwise causing physical injury to an animal or to another individual. Regardless of the nature of the impulsive aggressive outburst, the core feature of intermittent explosive disorder is failure to control impulsive aggressive behavior in response to subjectively experienced provocation (i. e. , psychosocial stressor) that would not typically result in an aggressive outburst (Criterion B). The aggressive outbursts are generally impulsive and/ or anger-based, rather than premeditated or instrumental (Criterion C) and are associated with significant distress or impairment in psychosocial function (Criterion D). A diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder should not be given to individuals younger than 6 years, or the equivalent developmental level (Criterion E), or to individuals whose aggressive outbursts are better explained by another mental disorder (Criterion F). A diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder should not be given to individuals with disruptive mood dysregulation disorder or to individuals whose impulsive aggressive outbursts are attributable to another medical condition or to the physiological effects of a substance (Criterion F). In addition, children ages 6-18 years should not receive this diagnosis when impulsive aggressive outbursts occur in the context of an adjustment disorder (Criterion F). Recording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis: Mood disorders (unipolar), anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders are associated with intermittent explosive disorder, although onset of these disorders is typically later than that of intermittent explosive disorder. Prevalence: One-year prevalence data for intermittent explosive disorder in the United States is about 2. 7% (narrow definition). Intermittent explosive disorder is more prevalent among younger individuals (e. g. , younger than 35-40 years), compared with older individuals (older than 50 years), and in individuals with a high school education or less\nDevelopment And Course: The onset of recurrent, problematic, impulsive aggressive behavior is most common in late childhood or adolescence and rarely begins for the first time after age 40 years. The core features of intermittent explosive disorder, typically, are persistent and continue for many years. The course of the disorder may be episodic, with recurrent periods of impulsive aggressive outbursts. Intermittent explosive disorder appears to follow a chronic and persistent course over many years. It also appears to be quite common regardless of the presence or absence of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or disruptive, impulsecontrol, and conduct disorders (e. g. , conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder). Risk And Prognostic Factors: Environmental. Individuals with a history of physical and emotional trauma during the first two decades of life are at increased risk for intermittent explosive disorder. Genetic and physiological. First-degree relatives of individuals v^ith intermittent explosive disorder are at increased risk for intermittent explosive disorder, and twin studies have demonstrated a substantial genetic influence for impulsive aggression. Research provides neurobiological support for the presence of serotonergic abnormalities, globally and in the brain, specifically in areas of the limbic system (anterior cingulate) and orbitofrontal cortex in individuals with intermittent explosive disorder. Amygdala responses to anger stimuli, during functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning, are greater in individuals with intermittent explosive disorder compared with healthy individuals\nCulture Related Diagnostic Issues: The lower prevalence of intermittent explosive disorder in some regions (Asia, Middle East) or countries (Romania, Nigeria), compared with the United States, suggests that information about recurrent, problematic, impulsive aggressive behaviors either is not elicited on questioning or is less likely to be present, because of cultural factors. Gender Related Diagnostic Issues: In some studies the prevalence of intermittent explosive disorder is greater in males than in females (odds ratio = 1. 4-2. 3); other studies have found no gender difference. Suicide Risk:  \nFunctional Consequences: Social (e. g. , loss of friends, relatives, marital instability), occupational (e. g. , demotion, loss of employment), financial (e. g. , due to value of objects destroyed), and legal (e. g. , civil suits as a result of aggressive behavior against person or property; criminal charges for assault) problems often develop as a result of intermittent explosive disorder. Diagnostic Markers:  \nDifferential Diagnosis: A diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder should not be made when Criteria A1 and/ or A2 are only met during an episode of another mental disorder (e. g. , major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, psychotic disorder), or when impulsive aggressive outbursts are attributable to another medical condition or to the physiological effects of a substance or medication. This diagnosis also should not be made, particularly in children and adolescents ages 6-18 years, when the impulsive aggressive outbursts occur in the context of an adjustment disorder. Other examples in which recurrent, problematic, impulsive aggressive outbursts may, or may not, be diagnosed as intermittent explosive disorder include the following. Disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. In contrast to intermittent explosive disorder, disruptive mood dysregulation disorder is characterized by a persistently negative mood state (i. e. , irritability, anger) most of the day, nearly every day, between impulsive aggressive outbursts. A diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder can only be given when the onset of recurrent, problematic, impulsive aggressive outbursts is before age 10 years. Finally, a diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder should not be made for the first time after age 18 years. Otherwise, these diagnoses are mutually exclusive. Antisocial personality disorder or borderline personality disorder. Individuals with antisocial personahty disorder or borderline personality disorder often display recurrent, problematic impulsive aggressive outbursts. However, the level of impulsive aggression in individuals with antisocial personality disorder or borderline personality disorder is lower than that in individuals with intermittent explosive disorder. Delirium, major neurocognitive disorder, and personality change due to another medical condition, aggressive type. A diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder should not be made when aggressive outbursts are judged to result from the physiological effects of another diagnosable medical condition (e. g. , brain injury associated with a change in personality characterized by aggressive outbursts; complex partial epilepsy). Nonspecific abnormalities on neurological examination (e. g. , \"soft signs\") and nonspecific electroencephalographic changes are compatible with a diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder unless there is a diagnosable medical condition that better explains the impulsive aggressive outbursts. Substance intoxication or substance withdrawal. A diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder should not be made when impulsive aggressive outbursts are nearly always associated with intoxication with or withdrawal from substances (e. g. , alcohol, phencyclidine, cocaine and other stimulants, barbiturates, inhalants). However, when a sufficient number of impulsive aggressive outbursts also occur in the absence of substance intoxication or withdrawal, and these warrant independent clinical attention, a diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder may be given. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, or autism spectrum disorder. Individuals with any of these childhood-onset disorders may exhibit impulsive aggressive outbursts. Individuals with ADHD are typically impulsive and, as a result, may also exhibit impulsive aggressive outbursts. While individuals with conduct disorder can exhibit impulsive aggressive outbursts, the form of aggression characterized by the diagnostic criteria is proactive and predatory. Aggression in oppositional defiant disorder is typically characterized by temper tantrums and verbal arguments with authority figures, whereas impulsive aggressive outbursts in intermittent explosive disorder are in response to a broader array of provocation and include physical assault. The level of impulsive aggression in individuals with a history of one or more of these disorders has been reported as lower than that in comparable individuals whose symptoms also meet intermittent explosive disorder Criteria A through E. Accordingly, if Criteria A through E are also met, and the impulsive aggressive outbursts warrant independent clinical attention, a diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder may be given\nComorbidity: Depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders are most commonly comorbid with intermittent explosive disorder. In addition, individuals with antisocial personality disorder or borderline personality disorder, and individuals with a history of disorders with disruptive behaviors (e. g. , ADHD, conduct disorder, oppositional defiant disorder), are at greater risk for comorbid intermittent explosive disorder.

'}\n  B: The disturbance in behavior causes clinically significant impairment in social, academic, or occupational functioning. C: If the individual is age 18 years or older, criteria are not met for antisocial personality disorder\nDisorder Id: 135\nDiagnostic Features: The essential feature of conduct disorder is a repetitive and persistent pattern of behavior in which the basic rights of others or major age-appropriate societal norms or rules are violated (Criterion A). These behaviors fall into four main groupings: aggressive conduct that causes or threatens physical harm to other people or animals (Criteria A1-A7); nonaggressive conduct that causes property loss or damage (Criteria A8-A9); deceitfulness or theft (Criteria A10-A12); and serious violations of rules (Criteria A13-A15). Three or more characteristic behaviors must have been present during the past 12 months, with at least one behavior present in the past 6 months. The disturbance in behavior causes clinically significant impairment in social, academic, or occupational functioning (Criterion B). The behavior pattern is usually present in a variety of settings, such as home, at school, or in the community. Because individuals with conduct disorder are likely to minimize their conduct problems, the clinician often must rely on additional informants. However, informants' knowledge of the individual's conduct problems may be limited if they have inadequately supervised the individual or the individual has concealed symptom behaviors. Individuals with conduct disorder often initiate aggressive behavior and react aggressively to others. They may display bullying, threatening, or intimidating behavior (including bullying via messaging on Web-based social media) (Criterion Al); initiate frequent physical fights (Criterion A2); use a weapon that can cause serious physical harm (e. g. , a bat, brick, broken bottle, knife, gun) (Criterion A3); be physically cruel to people (Criterion A4) or animals (Criterion A5); steal while confronting a victim (e. g. , mugging, purse snatching, extortion, armed robbery) (Criterion A6); or force someone into sexual activity (Criterion AT). Physical violence may take the form of rape, assault, or, in rare cases, homicide. Deliberate destruction of others' property may include deliberate fire setting with the intention of causing serious damage (Criterion A8) or deliberate destroying of other people's property in other ways (e. g. , smashing car windows, vandalizing school property) (Criterion A9). Acts of deceitfulness or theft may include breaking into someone else's house, building, or car (Criterion AlO); frequently lying or breaking promises to obtain goods or favors or to avoid debts or obligations (e. g. , \"conning\" other individuals) (Criterion A ll); or stealing items of nontrivial value without confronting the victim (e. g. , shoplifting, forgery, fraud) (Criterion A12). Individuals with conduct disorder may also frequently commit serious violations of rules (e. g. , school, parental, workplace). Children with conduct disorder often have a pattern, beginning before age 13 years, of staying out late at night despite parental prohibitions (Criterion A13). Children may also show a pattern of running away from home overnight (Criterion A14). To be considered a symptom of conduct disorder, the running away must have occurred at least twice (or only once if the individual did not return for a lengthy period). Runaway episodes that occur as a direct consequence of physical or sexual abuse do not typically qualify for this criterion. Children with conduct disorder may often be truant from school, beginning prior to age 13 years (Criterion A15)\nRecording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis: Especially in ambiguous situations, aggressive individuals with conduct disorder frequently misperceive the intentions of others as more hostile and threatening than is the case and respond with aggression that they then feel is reasonable and justified. Personality features of trait negative emotionality and poor self-control, including poor frustration tolerance, irritability, temper outbursts, suspiciousness, insensitivity to punishment, thrill seeking, and recklessness, frequently co-occur with conduct disorder. Substance misuse is often an associated feature, particularly in adolescent females. Suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, and completed suicide occur at a higher-than-expected rate in individuals with conduct disorder. Prevalence: One-year population prevalence estimates range from 2% to more than 10%, with a median of 4%. The prevalence of conduct disorder appears to be fairly consistent across various countries that differ in race and ethnicity. Prevalence rates rise from childhood to adolescence and are higher among males than among females. Few children with impairing conduct disorder receive treatment\nDevelopment And Course: The onset of conduct disorder may occur as early as the preschool years, but the first significant symptoms usually emerge during the period from middle childhood through middle adolescence. Oppositional defiant disorder is a common precursor to the childhood-onset type of conduct disorder. Conduct disorder may be diagnosed in adults, however, symptoms of conduct disorder usually emerge in childhood or adolescence, and onset is rare after age 16 years. The course of conduct disorder after onset is variable. In a majority of individuals, the disorder remits by adulthood. Many individuals with conduct disorder\u2014particularly those with adolescent-onset type and those with few and milder symptoms\u2014achieve adequate social and occupational adjustment as adults. However, the early-onset type predicts a worse prognosis and an increased risk of criminal behavior, conduct disorder, and substance-related disorders in adulthood. Individuals with conduct disorder are at risk for later mood disorders, anxiety disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, impulse-control disorders, psychotic disorders, somatic symptom disorders, and substance-related disorders as adults. Symptoms of the disorder vary with age as the individual develops increased physical strength, cognitive abilities, and sexual maturity. Symptom behaviors that emerge first tend to be less serious (e. g. , lying, shoplifting), whereas conduct problems that emerge last tend to be more severe (e. g. , rape, theft while confronting a victim). However, there are wide differences among individuals, with some engaging in the more damaging behaviors at an early age (which is predictive of a worse prognosis). When individuals with conduct disorder reach adulthood, symptoms of aggression, property destruction, deceitfulness, and rule violation, including violence against co-workers, partners, and children, may be exhibited in the workplace and the home, such that antisocial personality disorder may be considered\nRisk And Prognostic Factors: Temperamental. Temperamental risk factors include a difficult undercontrolled infant temperament and lower-than-average intelligence, particularly with regard to verbal IQ. Environmental. Family-level risk factors include parental rejection and neglect, inconsistent child-rearing practices, harsh discipline, physical or sexual abuse, lack of supervision, early institutional living, frequent changes of caregivers, large family size, parental criminality, and certain kinds of familial psychopathology (e. g. , substance-related disorders). Community-level risk factors include peer rejection, association with a delinquent peer group, and neighborhood exposure to violence. Both types of risk factors tend to be more common and severe among individuals with the childhood-onset subtype of conduct disorder. Genetic and physiological. Conduct disorder is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. The risk is increased in children v^ith a biological or adoptive parent or a sibling with conduct disorder. The disorder also appears to be more common in children of biological parents with severe alcohol use disorder, depressive and bipolar disorders, or schizophrenia or biological parents who have a history of ADHD or conduct disorder. Family history particularly characterizes individuals with the childhood-onset subtype of conduct disorder. Slower resting heart rate has been reliably noted in individuals with conduct disorder compared with those without the disorder, and this marker is not characteristic of any other mental disorder. Reduced autonomic fear conditioning, particularly low skin conductance, is also well documented. However, these psychophysiological findings are not diagnostic of the disorder. Structural and functional differences in brain areas associated with affect regulation and affect processing, particularly frontotemporal-limbic connections involving the brain's ventral prefrontal cortex and amygdala, have been consistently noted in individuals with conduct disorder compared with those without the disorder. However, neuroimaging findings are not diagnostic of the disorder. Course modifiers. Persistence is more likely for individuals with behaviors that meet criteria for the childhood-onset subtype and qualify for the specifier ''with limited prosocial emotions\". The risk that conduct disorder will persist is also increased by co-occurring ADHD and by substance abuse\nCulture Related Diagnostic Issues: Conduct disorder diagnosis may at times be potentially misapplied to individuals in settings where patterns of disruptive behavior are viewed as near-normative (e. g. , in very threatening, high-crime areas or war zones). Therefore, the context in which the undesirable behaviors have occurred should be considered. Gender Related Diagnostic Issues: Males with a diagnosis of conduct disorder frequently exhibit fighting, stealing, vandalism, and school discipline problems. Females with a diagnosis of conduct disorder are more likely to exhibit lying, truancy, running away, substance use, and prostitution. Whereas males tend to exhibit both physical aggression and relational aggression (behavior that harms social relationships of others), females tend to exhibit relatively more relational aggression\nSuicide Risk:  \nFunctional Consequences: Conduct disorder behaviors may lead to school suspension or expulsion, problems in work adjustment, legal difficulties, sexually transmitted diseases, unplanned pregnancy, and physical injury from accidents or fights. These problems may preclude attendance in ordinary schools or living in a parental or foster home. Conduct disorder is often associated with an early onset of sexual behavior, alcohol use, tobacco smoking, use of illegal substances, and reckless and risk-taking acts. Accident rates appear to be higher among individuals with conduct disorder compared with those without the disorder. These functional consequences of conduct disorder may predict health difficulties when individuals reach midlife. It is not uncommon for individuals with conduct disorder to come into contact with the criminal justice system for engaging in illegal behavior. Conduct disorder is a common reason for treatment referral and is frequently diagnosed in mental health facilities for children, especially in forensic practice. It is associated with impairment that is more severe and chronic than that experienced by other clinic-referred children. Diagnostic Markers:  \nDifferential Diagnosis: Oppositional defiant disorder. Conduct disorder and oppositional defiant disorder are both related to symptoms that bring the individual in conflict with adults and other au- thority figures (e. g. , parents, teachers, work supervisors). The behaviors of oppositional defiant disorder ^re typically of a less severe nature than those of individuals with conduct disorder and do not include aggression toward individuals or animals, destruction of property, or a pattern of theft or deceit. Furthermore, oppositional defiant disorder includes problems of emotional dysregulation (i. e. , angry and irritable mood) that are not included in the definition of conduct disorder. When criteria are met for both oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder, both diagnoses can be given. Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Although children with ADHD often exhibit hyperactive and impulsive behavior that may be disruptive, this behavior does not by itself violate societal norms or the rights of others and therefore does not usually meet criteria for conduct disorder. When criteria are met for both ADHD and conduct disorder, both diagnoses should be given. Depressive and bipolar disorders. Irritability, aggression, and conduct problems can occur in children or adolescents with a major depressive disorder, a bipolar disorder, or disruptive mood dysregulation disorder. The behaviorial problems associated with these mood disorders can usually be distinguished from the pattern of conduct problems seen in conduct disorder based on their course. Specifically, persons with conduct disorder will display substantial levels of aggressive or non-aggressive conduct problems during periods in which there is no mood disturbance, either historically (i. e. , a history of conduct problems predating the onset of the mood disturbance) or concurrently (i. e. , display of some conduct problems that are premeditated and do not occur during periods of intense emotional arousal). In those cases in which criteria for conduct disorder and a mood disorder are met, both diagnoses can be given. Intermittent explosive disorder. Both conduct disorder and intermittent explosive disorder involve high rates of aggression. However, the aggression in individuals with intermittent explosive disorder is limited to impulsive aggression and is not premeditated, and it is not committed in order to achieve some tangible objective (e. g. , money, power, intimidation). Also, the definition of intermittent explosive disorder does not include the nonaggressive symptoms of conduct disorder. If criteria for both disorders are met, the diagnosis of intermittent explosive disorder should be given only when the recurrent impulsive aggressive outbursts warrant independent clinical attention. Adjustment disorders. The diagnosis of an adjustment disorder (with disturbance of conduct or with mixed disturbance of emotions and conduct) should be considered if clinically significant conduct problems that do not meet the criteria for another specific disorder develop in clear association with the onset of a psychosocial stressor and do not resolve within 6 months of the termination of the stressor (or its consequences). Conduct disorder is diagnosed only when the conduct problems represent a repetitive and persistent pattern that is associated with impairment in social, academic, or occupational functioning\nComorbidity: ADHD and oppositional defiant disorder are both common in individuals with conduct disorder, and this comorbid presentation predicts worse outcomes. Individuals who show the personality features associated with antisocial personality disorder often violate the basic rights of others or violate major age-appropriate societal norms, and as a result their pattern of behavior often meets criteria for conduct disorder. Conduct disorder may also co-occur with one or more of the following mental disorders: specific learning disorder, anxiety disorders, depressive or bipolar disorders, and substance-related disorders. Academic achievement, particularly in reading and other verbal skills, is often below the level expected on the basis of age and intelligence and may justify the additional diagnosis of specific learning disorder or a communication disorder.

Individuals with this disorder experience tension or affective arousal before setting a fire (Criterion B). There is a fascination with, interest in, curiosity about, or attraction to fire and its situational contexts (e. g. , paraphernalia, uses, consequences) (Criterion C). Individuals with this disorder are often regular \"watchers\" at fires in their neighborhoods, may set off false alarms, and derive pleasure from institutions, equipment, and personnel associated with fire. They may spend time at the local fire department, set fires to be affiliated with the fire department, or even become firefighters. Individuals with this disorder experience pleasure, gratification, or relief when setting the fire, witnessing its effects, or participating in its aftermath (Criterion D). The fire setting is not done for monetary gain, as an expression of sociopolitical ideology, to conceal criminal activity, to express anger or vengeance, to improve one's living circumstances, or in response to a delusion or a hallucination (Criterion E). The fire setting does not result from impaired judgment (e. g. , in major neurocognitive disorder or intellectual disability [intellectual developmental disorder]). The diagnosis is not made if the fire setting is better explained by conduct disorder, a manic episode, or antisocial personality disorder (Criterion F). Recording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis: Individuals with pyromania may make considerable advance preparation for starting a fire. They may be indifferent to the consequences to life or property caused by the fire, or they may derive satisfaction from the resulting property destruction. The behaviors may lead to property damage, legal consequences, or injury or loss of life to the fire setter or to others. Individuals who impulsively set fires (who may or may not have pyromania) often have a current or past history of alcohol use disorder. Prevalence: The population prevalence of pyromania is not known. The lifetime prevalence of fire setting, which is just one component of pyromania and not sufficient for a diagnosis by itself, was reported as 1. 13% in a population sample, but the most common comorbidities were antisocial personality disorder, substance use disorder, bipolar disorder, and pathological gambling (gambling disorder). In contrast, pyromania as a primary diagnosis appears to be very rare. Among a sample of persons reaching the criminal system with repeated fire setting, only 3. 3% had symptoms that met full criteria for pyromania\nDevelopment And Course: There are insufficient data to establish a typical age at onset of pyromania. The relationship between fire setting in childhood and pyromania in adulthood has not been documented. In individuals with pyromania, fire-setting incidents are episodic and may wax and wane in frequency. Longitudinal course is unknown. Although fire setting is a major problem in children and adolescents (over 40% of those arrested for arson offenses in the United States are younger than 18 years), pyromania in childhood appears to be rare. Juvenile fire setting is usually associated with conduct disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, or an adjustment disorder. Risk And Prognostic Factors:  \nCulture Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nGender Related Diagnostic Issues: Pyromania occurs much more often in males, especially those with poorer social skills and learning difficulties. Suicide Risk:  \nFunctional Consequences:  \nDiagnostic Markers:  \nDifferential Diagnosis: Other causes of intentional fire setting. It is important to rule out other causes of fire setting before giving the diagnosis of pyromania. Intentional fire setting may occur for profit, sabotage, or revenge; to conceal a crime; to make a political statement (e. g. , an act of terrorism or protest); or to attract attention or recognition (e. g. , setting a fire in order to discover it and save the day). Fire setting may also occur as part of developmental experimentation in childhood (e. g. , playing with matches, lighters, or fire). Other mental disorders. A separate diagnosis of pyromania is not given when fire setting occurs as part of conduct disorder, a manic episode, or antisocial personality disorder, or if it occurs in response to a delusion or a hallucination (e. g. , in schizophrenia) or is attributable to the physiological effects of another medical condition (e. g. , epilepsy). The diagnosis of pyromania should also not be given when fire setting results from impaired judgment associated with major neurocognitive disorder, intellectual disability, or substance intoxication. Comorbidity: There appears to be a high co-occurrence of substance use disorders, gambling disorder, depressive and bipolar disorders, and other disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorders with pyromania. Relationship To Other Classifications:.", "Disorder: Kleptomania\nICD-9: 312. 32, ICD-10: F63. 3\nNotes: \nDiagnostic Criteria:\n  A: Recurrent failure to resist impulses to steal objects tliat are not needed for personal use or for their monetary value\n  B: Increasing sense of tension immediately before committing the theft. C: Pleasure, gratification, or relief at the time of committing the theft. D: The stealing is not committed to express anger or vengeance and is not in response to a delusion or a hallucination. E: The stealing is not better explained by conduct disorder, a manic episode, or antisocial personality disorder\nDisorder Id: 137\nDiagnostic Features: The essential feature of kleptomania is the recurrent failure to resist impulses to steal items even though the items are not needed for personal use or for their monetary value (Criterion A). The individual experiences a rising subjective sense of tension before the theft (Criterion B) and feels pleasure, gratification, or relief when committing the theft (Criterion C). The stealing is not committed to express anger or vengeance, is not done in response to a delusion or hallucination (Criterion D), and is not better explained by conduct disorder, a manic episode, or antisocial personality disorder (Criterion E). The objects are stolen despite the fact that they are typically of little value to the individual, who could have afforded to pay for them and often gives them away or discards them. Occasionally the individual may hoard the stolen objects or surreptitiously return them. Although individuals with this disorder will generally avoid stealing when immediate arrest is probable (e. g. , in full view of a police officer), they usually do not preplan the thefts or fully take into account the chances of apprehension. The stealing is done without assistance from, or collaboration with, others\nRecording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis: Individuals with kleptomania typically attempt to resist the impulse to steal, and they are aware that the act is wrong and senseless. The individual frequently fears being apprehended and often feels depressed or guilty about the thefts. Neurotransmitter pathways associated with behavioral addictions, including those associated with the serotonin, dopamine, and opioid systems, appear to play a role in kleptomania as well\nPrevalence: Kleptomania occurs in about 4%-24% of individuals arrested for shoplifting. Its prevalence in the general population is very rare, at approximately 0. 3%-0. 6%. Females outnumber males at a ratio of 3:1. Development And Course: Age at onset of kleptomania is variable, but the disorder often begins in adolescence. However, the disorder may begin in childhood, adolescence, or adulthood, and in rare cases in late adulthood. There is little systematic information on the course of kleptomania, but three typical courses have been described: sporadic with brief episodes and long periods of remission; episodic with protracted periods of stealing and periods of remission; and chronic with some degree of fluctuation. The disorder may continue for years, despite multiple convictions for shoplifting. Risk And Prognostic Factors: Genetic and physiological. There are no controlled family history studies of kleptomania. However, first-degree relatives of individuals with kleptomania may have higher rates of obsessive-compulsive disorder than the general population. There also appears to be a higher rate of substance use disorders, including alcohol use disorder, in relatives of individuals with kleptomania than in the general population. Culture Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nGender Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nSuicide Risk:  \nFunctional Consequences: The disorder may cause legal, family, career, and personal difficulties\nDiagnostic Markers:  \nDifferential Diagnosis: Ordinary theft. Kleptomania should be distinguished from ordinary acts of theft or shoplifting. Ordinary theft (whether planned or impulsive) is deliberate and is motivated by the usefulness of the object or its monetary worth. Some individuals, especially adolescents, may also steal on a dare, as an act of rebellion, or as a rite of passage. The diagnosis is not made unless other characteristic features of kleptomania are also present. Kleptomania is exceedingly rare, whereas shoplifting is relatively common. Malingering. In malingering, individuals may simulate the symptoms of kleptomania to avoid criminal prosecution. Antisocial personality disorder and conduct disorder. Antisocial personality disorder and conduct disorder are distinguished from kleptomania by a general pattern of antisocial behavior. Manic episodes, psychotic episodes, and major neurocognitive disorder. Kleptomania should be distinguished from intentional or inadvertent stealing that may occur during a manic episode, in response to delusions or hallucinations (as in, e. g. , schizophrenia), or as a result of a major neurocognitive disorder. Comorbidity: Kleptomania may be associated with compulsive buying as well as with depressive and bipolar disorders (especially major depressive disorder), anxiety disorders, eating disorders (particularly bulimia nervosa), personality disorders, substance use disorders (especially alcohol use disorder), and other disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorders\nRelationship To Other Classifications:.", "Disorder: Other Specified Disruptive, Impulse-Control, and Conduct Disorder\nICD-9: 312. 89, ICD-10: F91. 8\nNotes: This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the disruptive, impulse-control, and conduct disorders diagnostic class.

Disorder Id: 181\nDiagnostic Features: The essential feature of delirium is a disturbance of attention or awareness that is accompanied by a change in baseline cognition that cannot be better explained by a preexisting or evolving neurocognitive disorder (NCD). The disturbance in attention (Criterion A) is manifested by reduced ability to direct, focus, sustain, and shift attention. Questions must be repeated because the individual's attention wanders, or the individual may perseverate with an answer to a previous question rather than appropriately shift attention. The individual is easily distracted by irrelevant stimuli. The disturbance in awareness is manifested by a reduced orientation to the environment or at times even to oneself. The disturbance develops over a short period of time, usually hours to a few days, and tends to fluctuate during the course of the day, often with worsening in the evening and night when external orienting stimuli decrease (Criterion B). There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings that the disturbance is a physiological consequence of an underlying medical condition, substance intoxication or withdrawal, use of a medication, or a toxin exposure, or a combination of these factors (Criterion E). The etiology should be coded according to the etiologically appropriate subtype (i. e. , substance or medication intoxication, substance withdrawal, another medical condition, or multiple etiologies). Delirium often occurs in the context of an underlying NCD. The impaired brain function of individuals with mild and major NCD renders them more vulnerable to delirium. There is an accompanying change in at least one other area that may include memory and learning (particularly recent memory), disorientation (particularly to time and place), alteration in language, or perceptual distortion or a perceptual-motor disturbance (Criterion C). The perceptual disturbances accompanying delirium include misinterpretations, illusions, or hallucinations; these disturbances are typically visual, but may occur in other modalities as well, and range from simple and uniform to highly complex. Normal attention/arousal, delirium, and coma lie on a continuum, with coma defined as the lack of any response to verbal stimuli. The ability to evaluate cognition to diagnose delirium depends on there being a level of arousal sufficient for response to verbal stimulation; hence, delirium should not be diagnosed in the context of coma (Criterion D). Many noncoma tose patients have a reduced level of arousal. Those patients who show only minimal responses to verbal stimulation are incapable of engaging with attempts at standardized testing or even interview. This inability to engage should be classified as severe inattention. Low-arousal states (of acute onset) should be recognized as indicating severe inattention and cognitive change, and hence delirium. They are clinically indistinguishable from delirium diagnosed on the basis of inattention or cognitive change elicited through cognitive testing and interview. Recording Procedures: Substance intoxication delirium ICD-9-CM, The name of the substance/medication intoxication delirium begins with the specific substance (e. g. , cocaine, dexamethasone) that is presumed to be causing the delirium. The diagnostic code is selected from the table included in the criteria set, which is based on the drug class. For substances that do not fit into any of the classes (e. g. , dexamethasone), the code for \"other substance\" should be used; and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of substance is unknown, the category \"unknown substance\" should be used. The name of the disorder is followed by the course (i. e. , acute, persistent), followed by the specifier indicating level of psychomotor activity (i. e. , hyperactive, hypoactive, mixed level of activity). Unlike the recording procedures for ICD-IO-CM, which combine the substance/medication intoxication delirium and substance use disorder into a single code, for ICD-9-CM a separate diagnostic code is given for the substance use disorder. For example, in the case of acute hyperactive intoxication delirium occurring in a man with a severe cocaine use disorder, the diagnosis is 292. 81 cocaine intoxication delirium, acute, hyperactive. An additional diagnosis of 304. 20 severe cocaine use disorder is also given. If the intoxication delirium occurs without a comorbid substance use disorder (e. g. , after a onetime heavy use of the substance), no accompanying substance use disorder is noted (e. g. , 292. 81 phencyclidine intoxication delirium, acute, hypoactive). ICD-IO-CM. The name of the substance/medication intoxication delirium begins with the specific substance (e. g. , cocaine, dexamethasone) that is presumed to be causing the delirium. The diagnostic code is selected from the table included in the criteria set, which is based on the drug class and presence or absence of a comorbid substance use disorder. For substances that do not fit into any of the classes (e. g. , dexamethasone), the code for \"other substance\" should be used; and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of substance is unknown, the category \"unknown substance\" should be used. When recording the name of the disorder, the comorbid substance use disorder (if any) is listed first, followed by the word \"with,\" followed by the name of the substance intoxication delirium, followed by the course (i. e. , acute, persistent), followed by the specifier indicating level of psychomotor activity (i. e. , hyperactive, hypoactive, mixed level of activity). For example, in the case of acute hyperactive intoxication delirium occurring in a man with a severe cocaine use disorder, the diagnosis is F14. 221 severe cocaine use disorder with cocaine intoxication delirium, acute, hyperactive. A separate diagnosis of the comorbid severe cocaine use disorder is not given. If the intoxication delirium occurs without a comorbid substance use disorder (e. g. , after a one-time heavy use of the substance), no accompanying substance use disorder is noted (e. g. , F16. 921 phencyclidine intoxication delirium, acute, hypoactive). Substance withdrawal delirium ICD-9~CM, The name of the substance/medication withdrawal delirium begins with the specific substance (e. g. , alcohol) that is presumed to be causing the withdrawal delirium. The diagnostic code is selected from substance-specific codes included in the coding note included in the criteria set. The name of the disorder is followed by the course (i. e. , acute, persistent), followed by the specifier indicating level of psychomotor activity (i. e. , hyperactive, hypoactive, mixed level of activity). Unlike the recording procedures for ICD-IO-CM, which combine the substance/medication withdrawal delirium and substance use disorder into a single code, for ICD-9-CM a separate diagnostic code is given for the substance use disorder. For example, in the case of acute h3\u03c6eractive withdrawal delirium occurring in a man with a severe alcohol use disorder, the diagnosis is 291. 0 alcohol withdrawal delirium, acute, hyperactive. An additional diagnosis of 303. 90 severe alcohol use disorder is also given. ICD-10~CM. The name of the substance/medication withdrawal delirium begins with the specific substance (e. g. , alcohol) that is presumed to be causing the withdrawal delirium. The diagnostic code is selected from substance-specific codes included in the coding note included in the criteria set. When recording the name of the disorder, the comorbid moderate or severe substance use disorder (if any) is listed first, followed by the word \"with,\" followed by the substance withdrawal delirium, followed by the course (i. e. , acute, persistent), followed by the specifier indicating level of psychomotor activity (i. e. , hyperactive, hypoactive, mixed level of activity). For example, in the case of acute hyperactive withdrawal delirium occurring in a man with a severe alcohol use disorder, the diagnosis is F10. 231 severe alcohol use disorder with alcohol withdrawal delirium, acute, hyperactive. A separate diagnosis of the comorbid severe alcohol use disorder is not given. Medication-induced delirium. The name of the medication-induced delirium begins with the specific substance (e. g. , dexamethasone) that is presumed to be causing the delirium. The name of the disorder is followed by the course (i. e. , acute, persistent), followed by the specifier indicating level of psychomotor activity (i. e. , hyperactive, hypoactive, mixed level of activity). For example, in the case of acute hyperactive medication-induced delirium occurring in a man using dexamethasone as prescribed, the diagnosis is 292. 81 (F19. 921) dexamethasone-induced delirium, acute, hyperactive. Associated Features Supporting Diagnosis: Delirium is often associated with a disturbance in the sleep-wake cycle. This disturbance can include daytime sleepiness, nighttime agitation, difficulty falling asleep, excessive sleepiness throughout the day, or wakefulness throughout the night. In some cases, complete reversal of the night-day sleep-wake cycle can occur. Sleep-wake cycle disturbances are very common in delirium and have been proposed as a core criterion for the diagnosis. The individual with delirium may exhibit emotional disturbances, such as anxiety, fear, depression, irritability, anger, euphoria, and apathy. There may be rapid and unpredictable shifts from one emotional state to another. The disturbed emotional state may also be evident in calling out, screaming, cursing, muttering, moaning, or making other sounds. These behaviors are especially prevalent at night and under conditions in which stimulation and environmental cues are lacking\nPrevalence: The prevalence of delirium is highest among hospitalized older individuals and varies depending on the individuals' characteristics, setting of care, and sensitivity of the detection method. The prevalence of delirium in the community overall is low (l%-2%) but increases with age, rising to 14% among individuals older than 85 years. The prevalence is 10%-30% in older individuals presenting to emergency departments, where the delirium often indicates a medical illness. The prevalence of delirium when individuals are admitted to the hospital ranges from 14% to 24%, and estimates of the incidence of delirium arising during hospitalization range from 6% to 56% in general hospital populations. Delirium occurs in 15%-53% of older individuals postoperatively and in 70%-87% of those in intensive care. Delirium occurs in up to 60% of individuals in nursing homes or post-acute care settings and in up to 83% of all individuals at the end of life. Development And Course: While the majority of individuals with delirium have a full recovery with or without treatment, early recognition and intervention usually shortens the duration of the delir- ium. Delirium may progress to stupor, coma, seizures, or death, particularly if the underlying cause remains untreated. Mortality among hospitalized individuals with delirium is high, and as many as 40% of individuals with delirium, particularly those with malignancies and other significant underlying medical illness, die within a year after diagnosis. Risk And Prognostic Factors: Environmental. Delirium may be increased in the context of functional impairment, immobility, a history of falls, low levels of activity, and use of drugs and medications with psychoactive properties (particularly alcohol and anticholinergics). Genetic and physiological. Both major and mild NCDs can increase the risk for delirium and complicate the course. Older individuals are especially susceptible to delirium compared with younger adults. Susceptibility to delirium in infancy and through childhood may be greater than in early and middle adulthood. In childhood, delirium may be related to febrile illnesses and certain medications (e. g. , anticholinergics). Culture Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nGender Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nSuicide Risk:  \nFunctional Consequences: Delirium itself is associated with increased functional decline and risk of institutional placement. Hospitalized individuals 65 years or older with delirium have three times the risk of nursing home placement and about three times the functional decline as hospitalized patients without delirium at both discharge and 3 months postdischarge\nDiagnostic Markers: In addition to laboratory findings characteristic of underlying medical conditions (or intoxication or withdrawal states), there is often generalized slowing on electroencephalography, and fast activity is occasionally found (e. g. , in some cases of alcohol withdrawal delirium). However, electroencephalography is insufficiently sensitive and specific for diagnostic use. Differential Diagnosis: Psychotic disorders and bipolar and depressive disorders with psychotic features. Delirium that is characterized by vivid hallucinations, delusions, language disturbances, and agitation must be distinguished from brief psychotic disorder, schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, and other psychotic disorders, as well as from bipolar and depressive disorders with psychotic features. Acute stress disorder. Delirium associated with fear, anxiety, and dissociative symptoms, such as depersonalization, must be distinguished from acute stress disorder, which is precipitated by exposure to a severely traumatic event. Malingering and factitious disorder. Delirium can be distinguished from these disorders on the basis of the often atypical presentation in malingering and factitious disorder and the absence of another medical condition or substance that is etiologically related to the apparent cognitive disturbance. Other neurocognitive disorders. The most common differential diagnostic issue when evaluating confusion in older adults is disentangling symptoms of delirium and dementia. The clinician must determine whether the individual has delirium; a delirium superimposed on a preexisting NCD, such as that due to Alzheimer's disease; or an NCD without delirium. The traditional distinction between delirium and dementia according to acuteness of onset and temporal course is particularly difficult in those elderly individuals who had a prior NCD that may not have been recognized, or who develop persistent cognitive impairment following an episode of delirium.

Disorder Id: 199\nDiagnostic Features: Personality traits are enduring patterns of perceiving, relating to, and thinking about the environment and oneself that are exhibited in a wide range of social and personal contexts. Only when personality traits are inflexible and maladaptive and cause significant functional impairment or subjective distress do they constitute personality disorders. The essential feature of a personality disorder is an enduring pattern of inner experience and behavior that deviates markedly from the expectations of the individual's culture and is manifested in at least two of the following areas: cognition, affectivity, interpersonal functioning, or impulse control (Criterion A). This enduring pattern is inflexible and pervasive across a broad range of personal and social situations (Criterion B) and leads to clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning (Criterion C). The pattern is stable and of long duration, and its onset can be traced back at least to adolescence or early adulthood (Criterion D). The pattern is not better explained as a manifestation or consequence of another mental disorder (Criterion E) and is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e. g. , a drug of abuse, a medication, exposure to a toxin) or another medical condition (e. g. , head trauma) (Criterion F). Specific diagnostic criteria are also provided for each of the personality disorders included in this chapter. The diagnosis of personality disorders requires an evaluation of the individual's longterm patterns of functioning, and the particular personality features must be evident by early adulthood. The personality traits that define these disorders must also be distinguished from characteristics that emerge in response to specific situational stressors or more transient mental states (e. g. , bipolar, depressive, or anxiety disorders; substance intoxication). The clinician should assess the stability of personality traits over time and across different situations. Although a single interview with the individual is sometimes sufficient for making the diagnosis, it is often necessary to conduct more than one interview and to space these over time. Assessment can also be complicated by the fact that the characteristics that define a personality disorder may not be considered problematic by the individual (i. e. , the traits are often ego-syntonic). To help overcome this difficulty, supplementary information from other informants may be helpful. Recording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis:  \nPrevalence:  \nDevelopment And Course: The features of a personality disorder usually become recognizable during adolescence or early adult life. By definition, a personality disorder is an enduring pattern of thinking, feeling, and behaving that is relatively stable over time. Some types of personality disorder (notably, antisocial and borderline personality disorders) tend to become less evident or to remit with age, whereas this appears to be less true for some other types (e. g. , obsessivecompulsive and schizotypal personality disorders). Personality disorder categories may be applied with children or adolescents in those relatively unusual instances in which the individual's particular maladaptive personality traits appear to be pervasive, persistent, and unlikely to be limited to a particular developmental stage or another mental disorder. It should be recognized that the traits of a personality disorder that appear in childhood will often not persist unchanged into adult life. For a personality disorder to be diagnosed in an individual younger than 18 years, the features must have been present for at least 1 year. The one exception to this is antisocial per- sonality disorder, which cannot be diagnosed in individuals younger than 18 years. Although, by definition, a personality disorder requires an onset no later than early adulthood, individuals may not come to clinical attention until relatively late in life. A personality disorder may be exacerbated following the loss of significant supporting persons (e. g. , a spouse) or previously stabilizing social situations (e. g. , a job). However, the development of a change in personality in middle adulthood or later life warrants a thorough evaluation to determine the possible presence of a personality change due to another medical condition or an unrecognized substance use disorder. Risk And Prognostic Factors:  \nCulture Related Diagnostic Issues: Judgments about personality functioning must take into account the individual's ethnic, cultural, and social background. Personality disorders should not be confused with problems associated with acculturation following immigration or with the expression of habits, customs, or religious and political values professed by the individual's culture of origin. It is useful for the clinician, especially when evaluating someone from a different background, to obtain additional information from informants who are familiar with the person's cultural background. Gender Related Diagnostic Issues: Certain personality disorders (e. g. , antisocial personality disorder) are diagnosed more frequently in males. Others (e. g. , borderline, histrionic, and dependent personality disorders) are diagnosed more frequently in females. Although these differences in prevalence probably reflect real gender differences in the presence of such patterns, clinicians must be cautious not to overdiagnose or underdiagnose certain personality disorders in females or in males because of social stereotypes about typical gender roles and behaviors\nSuicide Risk:  \nFunctional Consequences:  \nDiagnostic Markers:  \nDifferential Diagnosis: Other mental disorders and personality traits. Many of the specific criteria for the personality disorders describe features (e. g. , suspiciousness, dependency, insensitivity) that are also characteristic of episodes of other mental disorders. A personality disorder should be diagnosed only when ihe defining characteristics appeared before early adulthood, are typical of the individual's long-term functioning, and do not occur exclusively during an episode of another mental disorder. It may be particularly difficult (and not particularly useful) to distinguish personality disorders from persistent mental disorders such as persistent depressive disorder that have an early onset and an enduring, relatively stable course. Some personality disorders may have a \"spectrum\" relationship to other mental disorders (e. g. , schizotypal personality disorder with schizophrenia; avoidant personality disorder with social anxiety disorder [social phobia]) based on phenomenological or biological similarities or familial aggregation. Personality disorders must be distinguished from personality traits that do not reach the threshold for a personality disorder. Personality traits are diagnosed as a personality disorder only when they are inflexible, maladaptive, and persisting and cause significant functional impairment or subjective distress. Psychotic disorders. For the three personality disorders that may be related to the psychotic disorders (i. e. , paranoid, schizoid, and schizotypal), there is an exclusion criterion stating that the pattern of behavior must not have occurred exclusively during the course of schizophrenia, a bipolar or depressive disorder with psychotic features, or another psychotic disorder. When an individual has a persistent mental disorder (e. g. , schizophrenia) that was preceded by a preexisting personality disorder, the personality disorder should also be recorded, followed by \"premorbid\" in parentheses. Anxiety and depressive disorders. The clinician must be cautious in diagnosing personality disorders during an episode of a depressive disorder or an anxiety disorder, be- cause these conditions may have cross-sectional symptom features that mimic personality traits and may m^ke it more difficult to evaluate retrospectively the individual's long-term patterns of functioning. Posttraumatic stress disorder. When personality changes emerge and persist after an individual has been exposed to extreme stress, a diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder should be considered. Substance use disorders. When an individual has a substance use disorder, it is important not to make a personality disorder diagnosis based solely on behaviors that are consequences of substance intoxication or withdrawal or that are associated with activities in the service of sustaining substance use (e. g. , antisocial behavior). Personality change due to another medical condition. When enduring changes in personality arise as a result of the physiological effects of another medical condition (e. g. , brain tumor), a diagnosis of personality change due to another medical condition should be considered. Comorbidity:  \nRelationship To Other Classifications:.", "Disorder: Voyeuristic Disorder\nICD-9: 302. 82, ICD-10: F65. 3\nNotes: \nDiagnostic Criteria:\n  A: Over a period of at least 6 months, recurrent and intense sexual arousal from observing an unsuspecting person who is naked, in the process of disrobing, or engaging in sexual activity, as manifested by fantasies, urges, or behaviors. B: The individual has acted on these sexual urges with a nonconsenting person, or the sexual urges or fantasies cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. C: The individual experiencing the arousal and/or acting on the urges is at least 18 years of age\nDisorder Id: 213\nDiagnostic Features: The diagnostic criteria for voyeuristic disorder can apply both to individuals who more or less freely disclose this paraphilic interest and to those who categorically deny any sexual arousal from observing an unsuspecting person who is naked, disrobing, or engaged in sexual activity despite substantial objective evidence to the contrary. If disclosing individuals also report distress or psychosocial problems because of their voyeuristic sexual preferences, they could be diagnosed with voyeuristic disorder. On the other hand, if they declare no distress, demonstrated by lack of anxiety, obsessions, guilt, or shame, about these paraphilic impulses and are not impaired in other important areas of functioning because of tids sexual interest, and their psychiatric or legal histories indicate that they do not act on it, they could be ascertained as having voyeuristic sexual interest but should not be diagnosed with voyeuristic disorder. Nondisclosing individuals include, for example, individuals known to have been spying repeatedly on unsuspecting persons who are naked or engaging in sexual activity on separate occasions but who deny any urges or fantasies concerning such sexual behavior, and who may report that known episodes of watching unsuspecting naked or sexually active persons were all accidental and nonsexual. Others may disclose past episodes of observing unsuspecting naked or sexually active persons but contest any significant or sustained sexual interest in this behavior. Since these individuals deny having fantasies or impulses about watching others nude or involved in sexual activity, it follows that they would also reject feeling subjectively distressed or socially impaired by such impulses. Despite their nondisclosing stance, such individuals may be diagnosed with voyeuristic disorder. Recurrent voyeuristic behavior constitutes sufficient support for voyeurism (by fulfilling Criterion A) and simultaneously demonstrates that this paraphilically motivated behavior is causing harm to others (by fulfilling Criterion B). \"Recurrent\" spying on unsuspecting persons who are naked or engaging in sexual activity (i. e. , multiple victims, each on a separate occasion) may, as a general rule, be interpreted as three or more victims on separate occasions. Fewer victims can be interpreted as satisfying this criterion if there were multiple occasions of watching the same victim or if there is corroborating evidence of a distinct or preferential interest in secret watching of naked or sexually active unsuspecting persons. Note that multiple victims, as suggested earlier, are a sufficient but not a necessary condition for diagnosis; the criteria may also be met if the individual acknowledges intense voyeuristic sexual interest. The Criterion A time frame, indicating that signs or symptoms of voyeurism must have persisted for at least 6 months, should also be understood as a general guideline, not a strict threshold, to ensure that the sexual interest in secretly watching unsuspecting naked or sexually active others is not merely transient. Adolescence and puberty generally increase sexual curiosity and activity. To alleviate the risk of pathologizing normative sexual interest and behavior during pubertal adolescence, the minimum age for the diagnosis of voyeuristic disorder is 18 years (Criterion C). Recording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis:  \nPrevalence: Voyeuristic acts are the most common of potentially law-breaking sexual behaviors. The population prevalence of voyeuristic disorder is unknown. However, based on voyeuris\u00ad tic sexual acts in nonclinical samples, the highest possible lifetime prevalence for voyeuristic disorder is approximately 12% in males and 4% in females. Development And Course: Adult males with voyeuristic disorder often first become aware of their sexual interest in secretly watching unsuspecting persons during adolescence. However, the minimum age for a diagnosis of voyeuristic disorder is 18 years because there is substantial difficulty in differentiating it from age-appropriate puberty-related sexual curiosity and activity. The persistence of voyeurism over time is unclear. Voyeuristic disorder, however, per definition requires one or more contributing factors that may change over time with or without treatment: subjective distress (e. g. , guilt, shame, intense sexual frustration, loneliness), psychiatric morbidity, hypersexuality, and sexual impulsivity; psychosocial impairment; and/or the propensity to act out sexually by spying on unsuspecting naked or sexually active persons. Therefore, the course of voyeuristic disorder is likely to vary with age. Risk And Prognostic Factors: Iemperamental. Voyeurism is a necessary precondition for voyeuristic disorder; hence, risk factors for voyeurism should also increase the rate of voyeuristic disorder. Environmental. Childhood sexual abuse, substance misuse, and sexual preoccupation/ hypersexuality have been suggested as risk factors, although the causal relationship to voyeurism is uncertain and the specificity unclear. Culture Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nGender Related Diagnostic Issues: Voyeuristic disorder is very uncommon among females in clinical settings, while the maleto-female ratio for single sexually arousing voyeuristic acts might be 3:1. Suicide Risk:  \nFunctional Consequences:  \nDiagnostic Markers:  \nDifferential Diagnosis: Conduct disorder and antisocial personality disorder. Conduct disorder in adolescents and antisocial personality disorder would be characterized by additional norm-breaking and antisocial behaviors, and the specific sexual interest in secretly watching unsuspecting others who are naked or engaging in sexual activity should be lacking. Substance use disorders. Substance use disorders might involve single voyeuristic episodes by intoxicated individuals but should not involve the typical sexual interest in secretly watching unsuspecting persons being naked or engaging in sexual activity. Hence, recurrent voyeuristic sexual fantasies, urges, or behaviors that occur also when the individual is not intoxicated suggest that voyeuristic disorder might be present. Comorbidity: Known comorbidities in voyeuristic disorder are largely based on research with males suspected of or convicted for acts involving the secret watching of unsuspecting nude or sexually active persons. Hence, these comorbidities might not apply to all individuals with voyeuristic disorder. Conditions that occur comorbidly with voyeuristic disorder include hypersexuality and other paraphilic disorders, particularly exhibitionistic disorder. Depressive, bipolar, anxiety, and substance use disorders; attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; and conduct disorder and antisocial personality disorder are also frequent comorbid conditions. Relationship To Other Classifications:.", "Disorder: Exhibitionistic Disorder\nICD-9: 302. 4, ICD-10: F65. 2\nNotes: \nDiagnostic Criteria:\n  A: The individual experiencing the arousal and/or acting on the urges is at least 18 years of age\n  B: The individual has acted on these sexual urges with a nonconsenting person, or the sexual urges or fantasies cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Disorder Id: 214\nDiagnostic Features: The diagnostic criteria for exhibitionistic disorder can apply both to individuals who more or less freely disclose this paraphilia and to those who categorically deny any sexual attraction to exposing their genitals to unsuspecting persons despite substantial objective evidence to the contrary. If disclosing individuals also report psychosocial difficulties because of their sexual attractions or preferences for exposing, they may be diagnosed with exhibitionistic disorder. In contrast, if they declare no distress (exemplified by absence of anxiety, obsessions, and guilt or shame about these paraphilic impulses) and are not impaired by this sexual interest in other important areas of functioning, and their self-reported, psychiatric, or legal histories indicate that they do not act on them, they could be ascertained as having exhibitionistic sexual interest but not be diagnosed with exhibitionistic disorder. Examples of nondisclosing individuals include those who have exposed themselves repeatedly to unsuspecting persons on separate occasions but who deny any urges or fan\u00ad tasies about such sexual behavior and who report that known episodes of exposure were all accidental and nonsexual. Others may disclose past episodes of sexual behavior involving genital exposure but refute any significant or sustained sexual interest in such behavior. Since these individuals deny having urges or fantasies involving genital exposure, it follows that they would also deny feeling subjectively distressed or socially impaired by such impulses. Such individuals may be diagnosed with exhibitionistic disorder despite their negative self-report. Recurrent exhibitionistic behavior constitutes sufficient support for exhibitionism (Criterion A) and simultaneously demonstrates that this paraphilically motivated behavior is causing harm to others (Criterion B). \"Recurrent\" genital exposure to unsuspecting others (i. e. , multiple victims, each on a separate occasion) may, as a general rule, be interpreted as three or more victims on separate occasions. Fewer victims can be interpreted as satisfying this criterion if there were multiple occasions of exposure to the same victim, or if there is corroborating evidence of a strong or preferential interest in genital exposure to unsuspecting persons. Note that multiple victims, as suggested earlier, are a sufficient but not a necessary condition for diagnosis, as criteria may be met by an individual's acknowledging intense exhibitionistic sexual interest with distress and/or impairment. The Criterion A time frame, indicating that signs or symptoms of exhibitionism must have persisted for at least 6 months, should also be understood as a general guideline, not a strict threshold, to ensure that the sexual interest in exposing one's genitals to unsuspecting others is not merely transient. This might be expressed in clear evidence of repeated behaviors or distress over a nontransient period shorter than 6 months. Recording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis:  \nPrevalence: The prevalence of exhibitionistic disorder is unknown. However, based on exhibitionistic sexual acts in nonclinical or general populations, the highest possible prevalence for exhibitionistic disorder in the male population is 2%-4%. The prevalence of exhibitionistic disorder in females is even more uncertain but is generally believed to be much lower than in males. Development And Course: Adult males with exhibitionistic disorder often report that they first became aware of sexual interest in exposing their genitals to unsuspecting persons during adolescence, at a somewhat later time than the typical development of normative sexual interest in women or men. Although there is no minimum age requirement for the diagnosis of exhibitionistic disorder, it may be difficult to differentiate exhibitionistic behaviors from age-appropriate sexual curiosity in adolescents. Whereas exhibitionistic impulses appear to emerge in adolescence or early adulthood, very little is known about persistence over time. By definition, exhibitionistic disorder requires one or more contributing factors, which may change over time with or without treatment; subjective distress (e. g. , guilt, shame, intense sexual frustration, loneliness), mental disorder comorbidity, hypersexuality, and sexual impulsivity; psychosocial impairment; and/or the propensity to act out sexually by exposing the genitals to unsuspecting persons. Therefore, the course of exhibitionistic disorder is likely to vary with age. As with other sexual preferences, advancing age may be associated with decreasing exhibitionistic sexual preferences and behavior. Risk And Prognostic Factors: Temperamental. Since exhibitionism is a necessary precondition for exhibitionistic disorder, risk factors for exhibitionism should also increase the rate of exhibitionistic disorder. Antisocial history, antisocial personality disorder, alcohol misuse, and pedophilic sexual preference might increase risk of sexual recidivism in exhibitionistic offenders. Hence, antisocial personality disorder, alcohol use disorder, and pedophilic interest may be considered ri^k factors for exhibitionistic disorder in males with exhibitionistic sexual preferences. Environmental. Childhood sexual and emotional abuse and sexual preoccupation/hypersexuality have been suggested as risk factors for exhibitionism, although the causal relationship to exhibitionism is uncertain and the specificity unclear. Culture Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nGender Related Diagnostic Issues: Exhibitionistic disorder is highly unusual in females, whereas single sexually arousing exhibitionistic acts might occur up to half as often among women compared with men. Suicide Risk:  \nFunctional Consequences: The functional consequences of exhibitionistic disorder have not been addressed in research involving individuals who have not acted out sexually by exposing their genitals to unsuspecting strangers but who fulfill Criterion B by experiencing intense emotional distress over these preferences. Diagnostic Markers:  \nDifferential Diagnosis: Potential differential diagnoses for exhibitionistic disorder sometimes occur also as comorbid disorders. Therefore, it is generally necessary to evaluate the evidence for exhibitionistic disorder and other possible conditions as separate questions. Conduct disorder and antisocial personality disorder. Conduct disorder in adolescents and antisocial personality disorder would be characterized by additional norm-breaking and antisocial behaviors, and the specific sexual interest in exposing the genitals should be lacking. Substance use disorders. Alcohol and substance use disorders might involve single exhibitionistic episodes by intoxicated individuals but should not involve the typical sexual interest in exposing the genitals to unsuspecting persons. Hence, recurrent exhibitionistic sexual fantasies, urges, or behaviors that occur also when the individual is not intoxicated suggest that exhibitionistic disorder might be present. Comorbidity: Known comorbidities in exhibitionistic disorder are largely based on research with individuals (almost all males) convicted for criminal acts involving genital exposure to nonconsenting individuals. Hence, these comorbidities might not apply to all individuals who qualify for a diagnosis of exhibitionistic disorder. Conditions that occur comorbidly with exhibitionistic disorder at high rates include depressive, bipolar, anxiety, and substance use disorders; hypersexuality; attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder; other paraphilic disorders; and antisocial personality disorder\nRelationship To Other Classifications:.", "Disorder: Frotteuristic Disorder\nICD-9: 302. 89, ICD-10: F65. 81\nNotes: \nDiagnostic Criteria:\n  A: Over a period of at least 6 months, recurrent and intense sexual arousal from touching or rubbing against a nonconsenting person, as manifested by fantasies, urges, or behaviors. B: The individual has acted on these sexual urges with a nonconsenting person, or the sexual urges or fantasies cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning\nDisorder Id: 215\nDiagnostic Features: The diagnostic criteria for frotteuristic disorder can apply both to individuals who relatively freely disclose this paraphilia and to those who firmly deny any sexual attraction from touching or rubbing against a nonconsenting individual regardless of considerable objective evidence to the contrary. If disclosing individuals also report psychosocial impairment due to their sexual preferences for touching or rubbing against a nonconsenting individual, they could be diagnosed with frotteuristic disorder. In contrast, if they declare no distress (demonstrated by lack of anxiety, obsessions, guilt, or shame) about these paraphilic impulses and are not impaired in other important areas of functioning because of this sexual interest, and their psychiatric or legal histories indicate that they do not act on it, they could be ascertained as having frotteuristic sexual interest but should not be diagnosed with frotteuristic disorder. Nondisclosing individuals include, for instance, individuals known to have been touching or rubbing against nonconsenting individuals on separate occasions but who contest any urges or fantasies concerning such sexual behavior. Such individuals may report that identified episodes of touching or rubbing against an unwilling individual were all unintentional and nonsexual. Others may disclose past episodes of touching or rubbing against nonconsenting individuals but contest any major or persistent sexual interest in this. Since these individuals deny having fantasies or impulses about touching or rubbing, they would consequently reject feeling distressed or psychosocially impaired by such impulses. Despite their nondisclosing position, such individuals may be diagnosed with frotteuristic disorder. Recurrent frotteuristic behavior constitutes satisfactory support for frotteurism (by fulfilling Criterion A) and concurrently demonstrates that this paraphilically motivated behavior is causing harm to others (by fulfilling Criterion B). \"Recurrent\" touching or rubbing against a nonconsenting individual (i. e. , multiple victims, each on a separate occasion) may, as a general rule, be inte\u03c6reted as three or more victims on separate occasions. Fewer victims can be inte\u03c6reted as satisfying this criterion if there were multiple occasions of touching or rubbing against the same unwilling individual, or corroborating evidence of a strong or preferential interest in touching or rubbing against nonconsenting individuals. Note that multiple victims are a sufficient but not a necessary condition for diagnosis; criteria may also be met if the individual acknowledges intense frotteuristic sexual interest with clinically significant distress and/or impairment. The Criterion A time frame, indicating that signs or symptoms of frotteurism must persist for at least 6 months, should also be inte\u03c6reted as a general guideline, not a strict threshold, to ensure that the sexual interest in touching or rubbing against a nonconsenting individual is not transient. Hence, the duration part of Criterion A may also be met if there is clear evidence of recurrent behaviors or distress over a shorter but nontransient time period\nRecording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis:  \nPrevalence: Frotteuristic acts, including the uninvited sexual touching of or rubbing against another individual, may occur in up to 30% of adult males in the general population. Approximately 10%-14% of adult males seen in outpatient settings for paraphilic disorders and hypersexuality have a presentation that meets diagnostic criteria for frotteuristic disorder. Hence, whereas the population prevalence of frotteuristic disorder is unknown, it is not likely that it exceeds the rate found in selected clinical settings. Development And Course: Adult males with frotteuristic disorder often report first becoming aware of their sexual interest in surreptitiously touching unsuspecting persons during late adolescence or emerging adulthood. However, children and adolescents may also touch or rub against unwilling others in the absence of a diagnosis of frotteuristic disorder. Although there is no minimum age for the diagnosis, frotteuristic disorder can be difficult to differentiate from conduct-disordered behavior without sexual motivation in individuals at younger ages. The persistence of frotteurism over time is unclear. Frotteuristic disorder, however, by definition requires one or more contributing factors that may change over time with or without treatment: subjective distress (e. g. , guilt, shame, intense sexual frustration, loneliness); psychiatric morbidity; hypersexuality and sexual impulsivity; psychosocial impairment; and/or the propensity to act out sexually by touching or rubbing against unconsenting persons. Therefore, the course of frotteuristic disorder is likely to vary with age. As with other sexual preferences, advancing age may be associated with decreasing frotteuristic sexual preferences and behavior. Risk And Prognostic Factors: Temperamental. Nonsexual antisocial behavior and sexual preoccupation/hypersexuality might be nonspecific risk factors, although the causal relationship to frotteurism is uncertain and the specificity unclear. However, frotteurism is a necessary precondition for frotteuristic disorder, so risk factors for frotteurism should also increase the rate of frotteuristic disorder. Culture Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nGender Related Diagnostic Issues: There appear to be substantially fewer females with frotteuristic sexual preferences than males\nSuicide Risk:  \nFunctional Consequences:  \nDiagnostic Markers:  \nDifferential Diagnosis: Conduct disorder and antisocial personality disorder. Conduct disorder in adolescents and antisocial personality disorder would be characterized by additional norm-breaking and antisocial behaviors, and the specific sexual interest in touching or rubbing against a nonconsenting individual should be lacking. Substance use disorders. Substance use disorders, particularly those involving stimulants such as cocaine and amphetamines, might involve single frotteuristic episodes by intoxicated individuals but should not involve the typical sustained sexual interest in touching or rubbing against unsuspecting persons. Hence, recurrent frotteuristic sexual fantasies, urges, or behaviors that occur also when the individual is not intoxicated suggest that frotteuristic disorder might be present\nComorbidity: Known comorbidities in frotteuristic disorder are largely based on research with males suspected of or convicted for criminal acts involving sexually motivated touching of or rubbing against a nonconsenting individual. Hence, these comorbidities might not apply to other individuals with a diagnosis of frotteuristic disorder based on subjective distress over their sexual interest. Conditions that occur comorbidly with frotteuristic disorder include hypersexuality and other paraphilic disorders, particularly exhibitionistic disorder and voyeuristic disorder. Conduct disorder, antisocial personality disorder, depressive disorders, bipolar disorders, anxiety disorders, and substance use disorders also co-occur. Potential differential diagnoses for frotteuristic disorder sometimes occur also as comorbid disorders. Therefore, it is generally necessary to evaluate the evidence for frotteuristic disorder and possible comorbid conditions as separate questions. Relationship To Other Classifications:.", "Disorder: Sexual Masochism Disorder\nICD-9: 302. 83, ICD-10: F65. 51\nNotes: \nDiagnostic Criteria:\n  A: Over a period of at least 6 months, recurrent and intense sexual arousal from the act of being humiliated, beaten, bound, or othenwise made to suffer, as manifested by fantasies, urges, or behaviors\n  B: The fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Disorder Id: 216\nDiagnostic Features: The diagnostic criteria for sexual masochism disorder are intended to apply to individuals who freely admit to having such paraphilic interests. Such individuals openly acknowledge intense sexual arousal from the act of being humiliated, beaten, bound, or otherwise made to suffer, as manifested by fantasies, urges, or behaviors. If these individuals also report psychosocial difficulties because of their sexual attractions or preferences for being humiliated, beaten, bound, or otherwise made to suffer, they may be diagnosed with sexual masochism disorder. In contrast, if they declare no distress, exemplified by anxiety, obsessions, guilt, or shame, about these paraphilic impulses, and are not hampered by them in pursuing other personal goals, they could be ascertained as having masochistic sexual interest but should not be diagnosed with sexual masochism disorder. The Criterion A time frame, indicating that the signs or symptoms of sexual masochism must have persisted for at least 6 months, should be understood as a general guideline, not a strict threshold, to ensure that the sexual interest in being humiliated, beaten, bound, or otherwise made to suffer is not merely transient. However, the disorder can be diagnosed in the context of a clearly sustained but shorter time period. Recording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis: The extensive use of pornography involving the act of being humiliated, beaten, bound, or otherwise made to suffer is sometimes an associated feature of sexual masochism disorder. Prevalence: The population prevalence of sexual masochism disorder is unknown. In Australia, it has been estimated that 2. 2% of males and 1. 3% of females had been involved in bondage and discipline, sadomasochism, or dominance and submission in the past 12 months\nDevelopment And Course: Community individuals with paraphilias have reported a mean age at onset for masochism of 19. 3 years, although earlier ages, including puberty and childhood, have also been reported for the onset of masochistic fantasies. Very little is known about persistence over time. Sexual masochism disorder per definition requires one or more contributing factors, which may change over time with or without treatment. These include subjective distress (e. g. , guilt, shame, intense sexual frustration, loneliness), psychiatric morbidity, hypersexuality and sexual impulsivity, and psychosocial impairment. Therefore, the course of sexual masochism disorder is likely to vary with age. Advancing age is likely to have the same reducing effect on sexual preference involving sexual masochism as it has on other paraphilic or normophilic sexual behavior. Risk And Prognostic Factors:  \nCulture Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nGender Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nSuicide Risk:  \nFunctional Consequences: The functional consequences of sexual masochism disorder are unknown. However, masochists are at risk of accidental death while practicing asphyxiophilia or other autoerotic procedures. Diagnostic Markers:  \nDifferential Diagnosis: Many of the conditions that could be differential diagnoses for sexual masochism disorder (e. g. , transvestic fetishism, sexual sadism disorder, hypersexuality, alcohol and substance use disorders) sometimes occur also as comorbid diagnoses. Therefore, it is necessary to carefully evaluate the evidence for sexual masochism disorder, keeping the possibility of other paraphilias or other mental disorders as part of the differential diagnosis. Sexual masochism in the absence of distress (i. e. , no disorder) is also included in the differential, as individuals who conduct the behaviors may be satisfied with their masochistic orientation. Comorbidity: Known comorbidities with sexual masochism disorder are largely based on individuals in treatment. Disorders that occur comorbidly with sexual masochism disorder typically include other paraphilic disorders, such as transvestic fetishism.

B: The individual has acted on these sexual urges with a nonconsenting person, or the sexual urges or fantasies cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning\nDisorder Id: 217\nDiagnostic Features: The diagnostic criteria for sexual sadism disorder are intended to apply both to individuals who freely admit to having such paraphilic interests and to those who deny any sexual interest in the physical or psychological suffering of another individual despite substantial objective evidence to the contrary. Individuals who openly acknowledge intense sexual interest in the physical or psychological suffering of others are referred to as \"admitting individuals. \" If these individuals also report psychosocial difficulties because of their sexual attractions or preferences for the physical or psychological suffering of another individual, they may be diagnosed with sexual sadism disorder. In contrast, if admitting individuals declare no distress, exemplified by anxiety, obsessions, guilt, or shame, about these paraphilic impulses, and are not hampered by them in pursuing other goals, and their self-reported, psychiatric, or legal histories indicate that they do not act on them, then they could be ascertained as having sadistic sexual interest but they would not meet criteria for sexual sadism disorder. Examples of individuals who deny any interest in the physical or psychological suffering of another individual include individuals known to have inflicted pain or suffering on multiple victims on separate occasions but who deny any urges or fantasies about such sexual behavior and who may further claim that known episodes of sexual assault were either unintentional or nonsexual. Others may admit past episodes of sexual behavior involving the infliction of pain or suffering on a nonconsenting individual but do not report any significant or sustained sexual interest in the physical or psychological suffering of another individual. Since these individuals deny having urges or fantasies involving sexual arousal to pain and suffering, it follows that they would also deny feeling subjectively distressed or socially impaired by such impulses. Such individuals may be diagnosed with sexual sadism disorder despite their negative self-report. Their recurrent behavior constitutes clinical support for the presence of the paraphilia of sexual sadism (by satisfying Criterion A) and simultaneously demonstrates that their paraphilically motivated behavior is causing clinically significant distress, harm, or risk of harm to others (satisfying Criterion B). \"Recurrent\" sexual sadism involving nonconsenting others (i. e. , multiple victims, each on a separate occasion) may, as general rule, be interpreted as three or more victims on separate occasions. Fewer victims can be interpreted as satisfying this criterion, if there are multiple instances of infliction of pain and suffering to the same victim, or if there is corroborating evidence of a strong or preferential interest in pain and suffering involving multiple victims. Note that multiple victims, as suggested earlier, are a sufficient but not a necessary condition for diagnosis, as the criteria may be met if the individual acknowledges intense sadistic sexual interest. The Criterion A time frame, indicating that the signs or symptoms of sexual sadism must have persisted for at least 6 months, should also be understood as a general guideline, not a strict threshold, to ensure that the sexual interest in inflicting pain and suffering on nonconsenting victims is not merely transient. However, the diagnosis may be met if there is a clearly sustained but shorter period of sadistic behaviors. Recording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis: The extensive use of pornography involving the infliction of pain and suffering is sometimes an associated feature of sexual sadism disorder. Prevalence: The population prevalence of sexual sadism disorder is unknown and is largely based on individuals in forensic settings. Depending on the criteria for sexual sadism, prevalence varies widely, from 2% to 30%. Among civilly committed sexual offenders in the United States, less than 10% have sexual sadism. Among individuals who have committed sexually motivated homicides, rates of sexual sadism disorder range from 37% to 75%. Development And Course: Individuals with sexual sadism in forensic samples are almost exclusively male, but a representative sample of the population in Australia reported that 2. 2% of men and 1. 3% of women said they had been involved in bondage and discipline, \"sadomasochism,\" or dominance and submission in the previous year. Information on the development and course of sexual sadism disorder is extremely limited. One study reported that females became aware of their sadomasochistic orientation as young adults, and another reported that the mean age at onset of sadism in a group of males was 19. 4 years. Whereas sexual sadism per se is probably a lifelong characteristic, sexual sadism disorder may fluctuate according to the individual's subjective distress or his or her propensity to harm nonconsenting others. Advancing age is likely to have the same reducing effect on this disorder as it has on other paraphilic or normophilic sexual behavior\nRisk And Prognostic Factors:  \nCulture Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nGender Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nSuicide Risk:  \nFunctional Consequences:  \nDiagnostic Markers:  \nDifferential Diagnosis: Many of the conditions that could be differential diagnoses for sexual sadism disorder (e. g. , antisocial personality disorder, sexual masochism disorder, hypersexuality, substance use disorders) sometimes occur also as comorbid diagnoses. Therefore, it is necessary to carefully evaluate the evidence for sexual sadism disorder, keeping the possibility of other paraphilias or mental disorders as part of the differential diagnosis. The majority of individuals who are active in community networks that practice sadistic and masochistic behaviors do not express any dissatisfaction with their sexual interests, and their behavior would not meet DSM-5 criteria for sexual sadism disorder. Sadistic interest, but not the disorder, may be considered in the differential diagnosis. Comorbidity: Known comorbidities with sexual sadism disorder are largely based on individuals (almost all males) convicted for criminal acts involving sadistic acts against nonconsenting victims. Hence, these comorbidities might not apply to all individuals who never engaged in sadistic activity with a nonconsenting victim but who qualify for a diagnosis of sexual sadism disorder based on subjective distress over their sexual interest. Disorders that are commonly comorbid with sexual sadism disorder include other paraphilic disorders. Relationship To Other Classifications:.", "Disorder: Pedophilic Disorder\nICD-9: 302. 2, ICD-10: F65. 4\nNotes: \nDiagnostic Criteria:\n  A: Over a period of at least 6 months, recurrent, intense sexually arousing fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors involving sexual activity with a prepubescent child or children (generally age 13 years or younger). B: The individual has acted on these sexual urges, or the sexual urges or fantasies cause marked distress or interpersonal difficulty\n  C: The individual is at least age 16 years and at least 5 years older than the child or children in Criterion A. Disorder Id: 218\nDiagnostic Features: The diagnostic criteria for pedophilic disorder are intended to apply both to individuals who freely disclose this paraphilia and to individuals who deny any sexual attraction to prepubertal children (generally age 13 years or younger), despite substantial objective evidence to the contrary. Examples of disclosing this paraphilia include candidly acknowledging an intense sexual interest in children and indicating that sexual interest in children is greater than or equal to sexual interest in physically mature individuals. If individuals also complain that their sexual attractions or preferences for children are causing psychosocial difficulties, they may be diagnosed with pedophilic disorder. However, if they report an absence of feelings of guilt, shame, or anxiety about these impulses and are not functionally limited by their paraphilic impulses (according to self-report, objective assessment, or both), and their self-reported and legally recorded histories indicate that they have never acted on their impulses, then these individuals have a pedophilic sexual orientation but not pedophilic disorder. Examples of individuals who deny attraction to children include individuals who are known to have sexually approached multiple children on separate occasions but who deny any urges or fantasies about sexual behavior involving children, and who may further claim that the known episodes of physical contact were all unintentional and nonsexual. Other individuals may acknowledge past episodes of sexual behavior involving children but deny any significant or sustained sexual interest in children. Since these individuals may deny experiences impulses or fantasies involving children, they may also deny feeling subjectively distressed. Such individuals may still be diagnosed with pedophilic disorder despite the absence of self-reported distress, provided that there is evidence of recurrent behaviors persisting for 6 months (Criterion A) and evidence that the individual has acted on sexual urges or experienced interpersonal difficulties as a consequence of the disorder (Criterion B). Presence of multiple victims, as discussed above, is sufficient but not necessary for diagnosis; that is, the individual can still meet Criterion A by merely acknowledging intense or preferential sexual interest in children. The Criterion A clause, indicating that the signs or symptoms of pedophilia have persisted for 6 months or longer, is intended to ensure that the sexual attraction to children is not merely transient. However, the diagnosis may be made if there is clinical evidence of sustained persistence of the sexual attraction to children even if the 6-month duration cannot be precisely determined. Recording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis: The extensive use of pornography depicting prepubescent children is a useful diagnostic indicator of pedophilic disorder. This is a specific instance of the general case that individuals are likely to choose the kind of pornography that corresponds to their sexual interests. Prevalence: The population prevalence of pedophilic disorder is unknown. The highest possible prevalence for pedophilic disorder in the male population is approximately 3%-5%. The population prevalence of pedophilic disorder in females is even more uncertain, but it is likely a small fraction of the prevalence in males\nDevelopment And Course: Adult males with pedophilic disorder may indicate that they become aware of strong or preferential sexual interest in children around the time of puberty\u2014the same time frame in which males who later prefer physically mature partners became aware of their sexual interest in women or men. Attempting to diagnose pedophilic disorder at the age at which it first manifests is problematic because of the difficulty during adolescent development in differentiating it from age-appropriate sexual interest in peers or from sexual curiosity. Hence, Criterion C requires for diagnosis a minimum age of 16 years and at least 5 years older than the child or children in Criterion A. Pedophilia per se appears to be a lifelong condition. Pedophilic disorder, however, necessarily includes other elements that may change over time with or without treatment: subjective distress (e. g. , guilt, shame, intense sexual frustration, or feelings of isolation) or psychosocial impairment, or the propensity to act out sexually with children, or both. Therefore, the course of pedophilic disorder may fluctuate, increase, or decrease with age. Adults with pedophilic disorder may report an awareness of sexual interest in children that preceded engaging in sexual behavior involving children or self-identification as a pedophile. Advanced age is as likely to similarly diminish the frequency of sexual behavior involving children as it does other paraphilically motivated and normophilic sexual behavior. Risk And Prognostic Factors: Temperamental. There appears to be an interaction between pedophilia and antisociality, such that males with both traits are more likely to act out sexually with children. Thus, antisocial personality disorder may be considered a risk factor for pedophilic disorder in males with pedophilia. Environmental. Adult males with pedophilia often report that they were sexually abused as children. It is unclear, however, whether this correlation reflects a causal influence of childhood sexual abuse on adult pedophilia. Genetic and physiological. Since pedophilia is a necessary condition for pedophilic disorder, any factor that increases the probability of pedophilia also increases the risk of pedophilic disorder. There is some evidence that neurodevelopmental perturbation in utero increases the probability of development of a pedophilic orientation. Culture Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nGender Related Diagnostic Issues: Psychophysiological laboratory measures of sexual interest, which are sometimes useful in diagnosing pedophilic disorder in males, are not necessarily useful in diagnosing this disorder in females, even when an identical procedure (e. g. , viewing time) or analogous procedures (e. g. , penile plethysmography and vaginal photoplethysmography) are available. Suicide Risk:  \nFunctional Consequences:  \nDiagnostic Markers: Psychophysiological measures of sexual interest may sometimes be useful when an individual's history suggests the possible presence of pedophilic disorder but the individual denies strong or preferential attraction to children. The most thoroughly researched and longest used of such measures is penile plethysmography, although the sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis may vary from one site to another. Viewing time, using photographs of nude or minimally clothed persons as visual stimuli, is also used to diagnose pedophilic disorder, especially in combination with self-report measures. Mental health professionals in the United States, however, should be aware that possession of such visual stimuli, even for diagnostic purposes, may violate American law regarding possession of child pornography and leave the mental health professional susceptible to criminal prosecution. Differential Diagnosis: Many of the conditions that could be differential diagnoses for pedophilic disorder also sometimes occur as comorbid diagnoses. It is therefore generally necessary to evaluate the evidence for pedophilic disorder and other possible conditions as separate questions. Antisocial personality disorder. This disorder increases the likelihood that a person who is primarily attracted to the mature physique will approach a child, on one or a few occasions, on the basis of relative availability. The individual often shows other signs of this personality disorder, such as recurrent law-breaking. Alcohol and substance use disorders. The disinhibiting effects of intoxication may also increase the likelihood that a person who is primarily attracted to the mature physique will sexually approach a child. Obsessive-compulsive disorder. There are occasional individuals who complain about ego-dystonic thoughts and worries about possible attraction to children. Clinical interviewing usually reveals an absence of sexual thoughts about children during high states of sexual arousal (e. g. , approaching orgasm during masturbation) and sometimes additional ego-dystonic, intrusive sexual ideas (e. g. , concerns about homosexuality). Comorbidity: Psychiatric comorbidity of pedophilic disorder includes substance use disorders; depressive, bipolar, and anxiety disorders; antisocial personality disorder; and other paraphilic disorders. However, findings on comorbid disorders are largely among individuals convicted for sexual offenses involving children (almost all males) and may not be generalizable to other individuals with pedophilic disorder (e. g. , individuals who have never approached a child sexually but who qualify for the diagnosis of pedophilic disorder on the basis of subjective distress)\nRelationship To Other Classifications:.", "Disorder: Fetishistic Disorder\nICD-9: 302. 81, ICD-10: F65. 0\nNotes: \nDiagnostic Criteria:\n  A: Over a period of at least 6 months, recurrent and intense sexual arousal from either the use of nonliving objects or a highly specific focus on nongenital body part(s), as manifested by fantasies, urges, or behaviors. B: The fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning\n  C: The fetish objects are not limited to articles of clothing used in cross-dressing (as in transvestic disorder) or devices specifically designed for the purpose of tactile genital stimulation (e. g. , vibrator)\nDisorder Id: 219\nDiagnostic Features: The paraphilic focus of fetishistic disorder involves the persistent and repetitive use of or dependence on nonliving objects or a highly specific focus on a (typically nongenital) body part as primary elements associated with sexual arousal (Criterion A). A diagnosis of fetishistic disorder must include clinically significant personal distress or psychosocial role impairment (Criterion B). Common fetish objects include female undergarments, male or female footwear, rubber articles, leather clothing, or other wearing apparel. Highly eroticized body parts associated with fetishistic disorder include feet, toes, and hair. It is not uncommon for sexualized fetishes to include both inanimate objects and body parts (e. g. , dirty socks and feet), and for this reason the definition of fetishistic disorder now re-incorporates partialism (i. e. , an exclusive focus on a body part) into its boundaries. Partialism, previously considered a paraphilia not otherwise specified disorder, had historically been subsumed in fetishism prior to DSM-\u03a0\u0399. Many individuals who self-identify as fetishist practitioners do not necessarily report clinical impairment in association with their fetish-associated behaviors. Such individuals could be considered as having a fetish but not fetishistic disorder. A diagnosis of fetishistic disorder requires concurrent fulfillment of both the behaviors in Criterion A and the clinically significant distress or impairment in functioning noted in Criterion B. Recording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis: Fetishistic disorder can be a multisensory experience, including holding, tasting, rubbing, inserting, or smelling the fetish object while masturbating, or preferring that a sexual partner wear or utilize a fetish object during sexual encounters. Some individuals may acquire extensive collections of highly desired fetish objects\nPrevalence:  \nDevelopment And Course: Usually paraphilias have an onset during puberty, but fetishes can develop prior to adolescence. Once established, fetishistic disorder tends to have a continuous course that fluctuates in intensity and frequency of urges or behavior. Risk And Prognostic Factors:  \nCulture Related Diagnostic Issues: Knowledge of and appropriate consideration for normative aspects of sexual behavior are important factors to explore to establish a clinical diagnosis of fetishistic disorder and to distinguish a clinical diagnosis from a socially acceptable sexual behavior. Gender Related Diagnostic Issues: Fetishistic disorder has not been systematically reported to occur in females. In clinical samples, fetishistic disorder is nearly exclusively reported in males. Suicide Risk:  \nFunctional Consequences: Typical impairments associated with fetishistic disorder include sexual dysfunction during romantic reciprocal relationships when the preferred fetish object or body part is unavailable during foreplay or coitus. Some individuals with fetishistic disorder may prefer solitary sexual activity associated with their fetishistic preference(s) even while involved in a meaningful reciprocal and affectionate relationship. Although fetishistic disorder is relatively uncommon among arrested sexual offenders with paraphilias, males with fetishistic disorder may steal and collect their particular fetishistic objects of desire. Such individuals have been arrested and charged for nonsexual antisocial behaviors (e. g. , breaking and entering, theft, burglary) that are primarily motivated by the fetishistic disorder. Diagnostic Markers:  \nDifferential Diagnosis: Transvestic disorder. The nearest diagnostic neighbor of fetishistic disorder is transvestic disorder. As noted in the diagnostic criteria, fetishistic disorder is not diagnosed when fetish objects are limited to articles of clothing exclusively worn during cross-dressing (as in transvestic disorder), or when the object is genitally stimulating because it has been designed for that purpose (e. g. , a vibrator). Sexual masochism disorder or other paraphilic disorders. Fetishes can co-occur with other paraphilic disorders, especially \"sadomasochism\" and transvestic disorder. When an individual fantasizes about or engages in \"forced cross-dressing\" and is primarily sexually aroused by the domination or humiliation associated with such fantasy or repetitive activity, the diagnosis of sexual masochism disorder should be made. Fetishistic behavior without fetishistic disorder. Use of a fetish object for sexual arousal without any associated distress or psychosocial role impairment or other adverse consequence would not meet criteria for fetishistic disorder, as the threshold required by Criterion B would not be met. For example, an individual whose sexual partner either shares or can successfully incorporate his interest in caressing, smelling, or licking feet or toes as an important element of foreplay would not be diagnosed with fetishistic disorder; nor would an individual who prefers, and is not distressed or impaired by, solitary sexual behavior associated with wearing rubber garments or leather boots. Comorbidity: Fetishistic disorder may co-occur with other paraphilic disorders as well as hypersexuality. Rarely, fetishistic disorder may be associated with neurological conditions.

Disorder Id: 220\nDiagnostic Features: The diagnosis of transvestic disorder does not apply to all individuals who dress as the opposite sex, even those who do so habitually. It applies to individuals whose cross-dressing or thoughts of cross-dressing are always or often accompanied by sexual excitement (Criterion A) and who are emotionally distressed by this pattern or feel it impairs social or interpersonal functioning (Criterion B). The cross-dressing may involve only one or two articles of clothing (e. g. , for men, it may pertain only to women's undergarments), or it may involve dressing completely in the iimer and outer garments of the other sex and (in men) may include the use of women's wigs and make-up. Transvestic disorder is nearly exclusively reported in males. Sexual arousal, in its most obvious form of penile erection, may co-occur with cross-dressing in various ways. In younger males, cross-dressing often leads to masturbation, following which any female clothing is removed. Older males often leam to avoid masturbating or doing anything to stimulate the penis so that the avoidance of ejaculation allows them to prolong their cross-dressing session. Males with female partners sometimes complete a cross-dressing session by having intercourse with their partners, and some have difficulty maintaining a sufficient erection for intercourse without cross-dressing (or private fantasies of cross-dressing). Clinical assessment of distress or impairment, like clinical assessment of transvestic sexual arousal, is usually dependent on the individual's self-report. The pattern of behavior \"purging and acquisition\" often signifies the presence of distress in individuals with transvestic disorder. During this behavioral pattern, an individual (usually a man) who has spent a great deal of money on women's clothes and other apparel (e. g. , shoes, wigs) discards the items (i. e. , purges them) in an effort to overcome urges to cross-dress, and then begins acquiring a woman's wardrobe all over again. Recording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis: Transvestic disorder in men is often accompanied by autogynephilia (i. e. , a male's paraphilic tendency to be sexually aroused by the thought or image of himself as a woman). Autogynephilic fantasies and behaviors may focus on the idea of exhibiting female physiological functions (e. g. , lactation, menstruation), engaging in stereotypically feminine behavior (e. g. , knitting), or possessing female anatomy (e. g. , breasts)\nPrevalence: The prevalence of transvestic disorder is unknown. Transvestic disorder is rare in males and extremely rare in females. Fewer than 3% of males report having ever been sexually aroused by dressing in women's attire. The percentage of individuals who have crossdressed with sexual arousal more than once or a few times in their lifetimes would be even lower. The majority of males with transvestic disorder identify as heterosexual, although some individuals have occasional sexual interaction with other males, especially when they are cross-dressed. Development And Course: In males, the first signs of transvestic disorder may begin in childhood, in the form of strong fascination with a particular item of women's attire. Prior to puberty, cross-dressing produces generalized feelings of pleasurable excitement. With the arrival of puberty, dressing in women's clothes begins to elicit penile erection and, in some cases, leads di\u00ad rectly to first ejaculation. In many cases, cross-dressing elicits less and less sexual excitement as the individual grows older; eventually it may produce no discernible penile response at all. The desire to cross-dress, at the same time, remains the same or grows even stronger. Individuals who report such a diminution of sexual response typically report that the sexual excitement of cross-dressing has been replaced by feelings of comfort or well-being. In some cases, the course of transvestic disorder is continuous, and in others it is episodic. It is not rare for men with transvestic disorder to lose interest in cross-dressing when they first fall in love with a woman and begin a relationship, but such abatement usually proves temporary. When the desire to cross-dress returns, so does the associated distress. Some cases of transvestic disorder progress to gender dysphoria. The males in these cases, who may be indistinguishable from others with transvestic disorder in adolescence or early childhood, gradually develop desires to remain in the female role for longer periods and to feminize their anatomy. The development of gender dysphoria is usually accompanied by a (self-reported) reduction or elimination of sexual arousal in association with cross-dressing. The manifestation of transvestism in penile erection and stimulation, like the manifestation of other paraphilic as well as normophiHc sexual interests, is most intense in adolescence and early adulthood. The severity of transvestic disorder is highest in adulthood, when the transvestic drives are most likely to conflict with performance in heterosexual intercourse and desires to marry and start a family. Middle-age and older men with a history of transvestism are less likely to present with transvestic disorder than with gender dysphoria\nRisk And Prognostic Factors:  \nCulture Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nGender Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nSuicide Risk:  \nFunctional Consequences: Engaging in transvestic behaviors can interfere with, or detract from, heterosexual relationships. This can be a source of distress to men who wish to maintain conventional marriages or romantic partnerships with women. Diagnostic Markers:  \nDifferential Diagnosis: Fetishistic disorder. This disorder may resemble transvestic disorder, in particular, in men with fetishism who put on women's undergarments while masturbating with them. Distinguishing transvestic disorder depends on the individual's specific thoughts during such activity (e. g. , are there any ideas of being a woman, being like a woman, or being dressed as a woman?) and on the presence of other fetishes (e. g. , soft, silky fabrics, whether these are used for garments or for something else). Gender dysphoria. Individuals with transvestic disorder do not report an incongruence between their experienced gender and assigned gender nor a desire to be of the other gender; and they typically do not have a history of childhood cross-gender behaviors, which would be present in individuals with gender dysphoria. Individuals with a presentation that meets fuU criteria for transvestic disorder as weU as gender dysphoria should be given both diagnoses. Comorbidity: Transvestism (and thus transvestic disorder) is often found in association with other paraphilias. The most frequently co-occurring paraphilias are fetishism and masochism. One particularly dangerous form of masochism, autoerotic asphyxia, is associated with transvestism in a substantial proportion of fatal cases.

The clinical features described below are those considered most important in making the diagnosis of neuroleptic malignant syndrome based on consensus recommendations. Diagnostic Criteria:\nDisorder Id: 229\nDiagnostic Features: Patients have generally been exposed to a dopamine antagonist within 72 hours prior to symptom development. Hyperthermia (>100. 4\u00b0F or >38. 0\u00b0C on at least two occasions, measured orally), associated with profuse diaphoresis, is a distinguishing feature of neuroleptic malignant syndrome, setting it apart from other neurological side effects of antipsychotic medications. Extreme elevations in temperature, reflecting a breakdown in central thermoregulation, are more likely to support the diagnosis of neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Generalized rigidity, described as \"lead pipe\" in its most severe form and usually unresponsive to antiparkinsonian agents, is a cardinal feature of the disorder and may be associated with other neurological symptoms (e. g. , tremor, sialorrhea, akinesia, dystonia, trismus, myoclonus, dysarthria, dysphagia, rhabdomyolysis). Creatine kinase elevation of at least four times the upper limit of normal is commonly seen. Changes in mental status, characterized by delirium or altered consciousness ranging from stupor to coma, are often an early sign. Affected individuals may appear alert but dazed and unresponsive, consistent with catatonic stupor. Autonomic activation and instability\u2014manifested by tachycardia (rate >25% above baseline), diaphoresis, blood pressure elevation (systolic or diastolic >25% above baseline) or fluctuation (>20 mmHg diastolic change or >25 mmHg systolic change within 24 hours), urinary incontinence, and pallor\u2014may be seen at any time but provide an early clue to the diagnosis. Tachypnea (rate >50% above baseline) is common, and respiratory distress\u2014resulting from metabolic acidosis, hypermetabolism, chest wall restriction, aspiration pneumonia, or pulmonary emboli\u2014can occur and lead to sudden respiratory arrest. A workup, including laboratory investigation, to exclude other infectious, toxic, metabolic, and neuropsychiatric etiologies or complications is essential (see the section \"Differential Diagnosis\" later in this discussion). Although several laboratory abnormalities are associated with neuroleptic malignant syndrome, no single abnormality is specific to the diagnosis. Individuals with neuroleptic malignant syndrome may have leukocytosis, metabolic acidosis, hypoxia, decreased serum iron concentrations, and elevations in serum muscle enzymes and catecholamines. Findings from cerebrospinal fluid analysis and neuroimaging studies are generally normal, whereas electroencephalography shows generalized slowing. Autopsy findings in fatal cases have been nonspecific and variable, depending on complications. Recording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis:  \nPrevalence:  \nDevelopment And Course: Evidence from database studies suggests incidence rates for neuroleptic malignant syndrome of 0. 01%-0. 02% among individuals treated with antipsycho tics. The temporal progression of signs and symptoms provides important clues to the diagnosis and prognosis of neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Alteration in mental status and other neurological signs typically precede systemic signs. The onset of symptoms varies from hours to days after drug initiation. Some cases develop within 24 hours after drug initiation, most within the first week, and virtually all cases within 30 days. Once the syndrome is diagnosed and oral antipsychotic drugs are discontinued, neuroleptic malignant syndrome is self-limited in most cases. The mean recovery time after drug discontinuation is 7-10 days, with most individuals recovering within 1 week and nearly all within 30 days. The duration may be prolonged when long-acting antipsychotics are implicated. There have been reports of individuals in whom residual neurological signs persisted for weeks after the acute hypermetabolic symptoms resolved. Total resolution of symptoms can be obtained in most cases of neuroleptic malignant syndrome; however, fatality rates of 10%-20% have been reported when the disorder is not recognized. Although many individuals do not experience a recurrence of neuroleptic malignant syndrome when rechallenged with antipsychotic medication, some do, especially when antipsychotics are reinstituted soon after an episode\nRisk And Prognostic Factors: Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is a potential risk in any individual after antipsychotic drug administration. It is not specific to any neuropsychiatric diagnosis and may occur in individuals without a diagnosable mental disorder who receive dopamine antagonists. Clinical, systemic, and metabolic factors associated with a heightened risk of neuroleptic malignant syndrome include agitation, exhaustion, dehydration, and iron deficiency. A prior episode associated with antipsychotics has been described in 15%-20% of index cases, suggesting underlying vulnerability in some patients; however, genetic findings based on neurotransmitter receptor polymorphisms have not been replicated consistently. Nearly all dopamine antagonists have been associated with neuroleptic malignant sjmdrome, although high-potency antipsychotics pose a greater risk compared with lowpotency agents and newer atypical antipsychotics. Partial or milder forms may be associated with newer antipsychotics, but neuroleptic malignant syndrome varies in severity even with older drugs. Dopamine antagonists used in medical settings (e. g. , metoclopramide, prochlorperazine) have also been implicated. Parenteral administration routes, rapid titration rates, and higher total drug dosages have been associated with increased risk; however, neuroleptic malignant syndrome usually occurs within the therapeutic dosage range of antipsychotics\nCulture Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nGender Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nSuicide Risk:  \nFunctional Consequences:  \nDiagnostic Markers:  \nDifferential Diagnosis: Neuroleptic malignant syndrome must be distinguished from other serious neurological or medical conditions, including central nervous system infections, inflammatory or autoimmune conditions, status epilepticus, subcortical structural lesions, and systemic conditions (e. g. , pheochromocytoma, thyrotoxicosis, tetanus, heat stroke). Neuroleptic malignant syndrome also must be distinguished from similar syndromes resulting from the use of other substances or medications, such as serotonin syndrome; parkinsonian hyperthermia syndrome following abrupt discontinuation of dopamine agonists; alcohol or sedative withdrawal; malignant hyperthermia occurring during anesthesia; hyperthermia associated with abuse of stimulants and hallucinogens; and atropine poisoning from anticholinergics. In rare instances, individuals with schizophrenia or a mood disorder may present with malignant catatonia, which may be indistinguishable from neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Some investigators consider neuroleptic malignant syndrome to be a druginduced form of malignant catatonia.

The incidence of this syndrome depends on the dosage and half-life of the medication being taken, as well as the rate at which the medication is tapered. Short-acting medications that are stopped abruptly rather than tapered gradually may pose the greatest risk. The short-acting selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) paroxetine is the agent most commonly associated with discontinuation symptoms, but such symptoms occur for all types of antidepressants. Unlike withdrawal syndromes associated with opioids, alcohol, and other substances of abuse, antidepressant discontinuation syndrome has no pathognomonic symptoms. Instead, the symptoms tend to be vague and variable and typically begin 2-A days after the last dose of the antidepressant. For SSRIs (e. g. , paroxetine), symptoms such as dizziness, ringing in the ears, \"electric shocks in the head,\" an inability to sleep, and acute anxiety are described. The antidepressant use prior to discontinuation must not have incurred hypomania or euphoria (i. e. , there should be confidence that the discontinuation syndrome is not the result of fluctuations in mood stability associated with the previous treatment). The antidepressant discontinuation syndrome is based solely on pharmacological factors and is not related to the reinforcing effects of an antidepressant. Also, in the case of stimulant augmentation of an antidepressant, abrupt cessation may result in stimulant withdrawal symptoms (see \"Stimulant Withdrawal\" in the chapter \"Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders\") rather than the antidepressant discontinuation syndrome described here. Recording Procedures:  \nAssociated Features Supporting Diagnosis:  \nPrevalence: The prevalence of antidepressant discontinuation syndrome is unknown but is thought to vary according to the dosage prior to discontinuation, the half-life and receptor-binding affinity of the medication, and possibly the individual's genetically influenced rate of metabolism for this medication. Development And Course: Because longitudinal studies are lacking, litfle is known about the clinical course of antidepressant discontinuation syndrome. Symptoms appear to abate over time with very gradual dosage reductions. After an episode, some individuals may prefer to resume medication indefinitely if tolerated. Risk And Prognostic Factors:  \nCulture Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nGender Related Diagnostic Issues:  \nSuicide Risk:  \nFunctional Consequences:  \nDiagnostic Markers:  \nDifferential Diagnosis: The differential diagnosis of antidepressant discontinuation syndrome includes anxiety and depressive disorders, substance use disorders, and tolerance to medications. Anxiety and depressive disorders. Discontinuation symptoms often resemble symptoms of a persistent anxiety disorder or a return of somatic symptoms of depression for which the medication was initially given. Substance use disorders. Antidepressant discontinuation syndrome differs from substance withdrawal in that antidepressants themselves have no reinforcing or euphoric effects. The medication dosage has usually not been increased without the clinician's permission, and the individual generally does not engage in drug-seeking behavior to obtain additional medication. Criteria for a substance use disorder are not met. Tolerance to medications. Tolerance and discontinuation symptoms can occur as a normal physiological response to stopping medication after a substantial duration of exposure. Most cases of medication tolerance can be managed through carefully controlled tapering. Comorbidity: Typically, the individual was initially started on the medication for a major depressive disorder; the original symptoms may return during the discontinuation syndrome.
